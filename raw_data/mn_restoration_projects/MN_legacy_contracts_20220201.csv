Up to 20 percent of this appropriation is available for land-treatment projects and practices that benefit drinking water.","Based on the loss of approximately 50,000 tons of sediment from TCD 52 since 1951, this phase of the project will eliminate an annual estimated average of 750 tons of sediment entering Lake Traverse and other downstream waterbodies.",,,,LOCAL LEVERAGED FUNDS,,,"Members for Bois de Sioux WD are: Allen Wold, Benjamin Brutlag, Doug Dahlen, Jason Beyer, Jerome Deal, John Kapphahn, Linda Vavra, Scott Gillespie, Steve Schmidt",,Bois de Sioux WD,Local/Regional Government,,,"The project will stabilize approximately 3,500 feet of TCD 52 channel from State Highway 27 to Lake Traverse (project area). The project will reduce bed and bank scour, stabilize side slopes, and minimize erosion, resulting in a significant reduction in sediment and nutrient loading to Lake Traverse. The BdSWD, in partnership with the Traverse County SWCD, is proposing to reduce an estimated average of 750 tons per year of non-point pollutant sediment loading to Lake Traverse that discharges from Traverse County Ditch 52 (TCD 52) (AUID 09020101-540) downstream of Minnesota State Highway 27 due to hydrologic flows in the channel resulting in severe down cutting, bank failure and erosion. The project will result in water quality benefits to Lake Traverse and other downstream waterbodies, including Mud Lake, the Bois de Sioux River, and ultimately the Red River of the North, which provides drinking water to the City of Moorhead. The project will also have natural resource benefits to fisheries and wildlife. The BdSWD and local partners have a goal to completely stabilize TCD 52 in a series of phases in a comprehensive effort to address water quality impairments. The first phase (this project) is an eroded gully that is highly visible from MN State Highway 27. It is a locally well-known significant source of sediment and nutrients to Lake Traverse and the outlet of the watershed. Through recent efforts and coordination fueled by the WRAPS process, BdSWD and their partners, with landowner support, believe it is important to stabilize the outlet reach of TCD 52 first, and are committed to addressing other problem areas upstream from the outlet reach in future phases of the overall project plan. This first phase of the project will be used as a model for future upstream stabilization projects on TCD 52 that are experiencing similar issues.

9826blueearth,Lake Crystal Water Control Structure,2013,50000,,,,,,,,,,,,Blue Earth County,,"The shallow lake habitat of Lake Crystal is maintained by a deteriorating outlet structure built about 1920. A new water control structure is proposed to 1) eliminate the threat of dam failure that would cause abrupt lowering of the water elevation of the shallow water habitat, 2) improve access to and maintenance of the outlet water control structure, and 3) allow for potential water level adjustments and temporary draw downs in the future to improve water quality and fisheries/wildlife habitat, consistent with MN Stat.103G.408. The existing structure is deteriorating. Observed structure deficiencies include: seeping where the dam ties into railroad embankment, cracking, spalling, and displaced concrete, undermining concrete on downstream side of the dam, and sackrete fill and patches on large section at the top of the dam. If not replaced the dam could fail and compromise water levels in the lake. The sport fish community of the lake consists of black crappie, white crappie, northern pike, walleye, channel catfish, bluegill, and yellow perch. The walleye population is maintained through stocking. The lake outlet is located in an area of the lake bordered by MN Hwy 60. The outlet passes beneath both Hwy 60 and railroad right-of-ways. The existing structure is located between the highway and railroad. The lake outlet flows north through three, 115-inch diameter culverts into a small pond on the north side of Hwy 60. A 140-foot wide, low-head dam within the pond controls the elevation of the lake. From the dam, water flows under a railroad bridge through a ditch to Minneopa Creek. Maintenance of the existing structure has been challenging as it is located on railroad right-of-way between a four-lane highway and railroad. The new water control structure will be downstream of the existing structure just north of the railroad. Access to the site will be from City-owned property, greatly improving access for construction and maintenance of the new structure. The new structure will be a variable-crest water control structure to allow for managing water levels to improve fish/wildlife habitat by increasing rooted aquatic vegetation and water clarity. A drawdown is not planned at this time, but when determined to be in the public interest, with notification of all riparian landowners, a public hearing, permission of 75% of riparian landowners, and other provisions consistent with MN Stat. 103G.408, a drawdown will be possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44.115717,-94.211043

At VLP, three acres of floodplain and terrace forest along the Vermillion River will be enhanced through non-native woody species control and native shrub and wildflower planting, and roughly four acres of non-native grassland will be restored and enhanced to native prairie. At CHPOS, 11 acres of forest and woodland will be enhanced through non-native shrub removal, native shrub and understory additions, seeding, and a prescribed burn. Work at VLP and CHPOS will occur on extensions of areas that were previously restored with ENRTF, LSOHC and CPL funding, expanding the restored and enhanced areas at each site. Restoring and enhancing these new acres will help buffer the current restorations and decrease the amount of invasive propagules reaching currently restored areas. At RWP, 18 acres of forest and seven acres of prairie will be enhanced by removing non-native shrubs, adding native shrubs, and conducting prescribed burns. At RWP, proposed work occurs on acres previously enhanced with both LSOHC and ENRTF funds. This additional management and enhancement will ensure that the initial investment in these areas is maintained and the restorations do not degrade. Forest and prairie habitats at all three sites are plagued by invasive woody plants, which have degraded wildlife habitat and led to declines in the abundance and diversity of native plant and animal species. Removing these species and increasing the abundance and richness of shrub and forb species will benefit native wildlife and the provision of ecosystem services, providing much needed food and shelter, biotic resistance to future invasion, and soil stabilization and erosion prevention. At VLP, restoring prairie ? one of the state'd most imperiled ecosystems ? will provide important habitat for declining wildlife populations such as native pollinators, monarch butterflies and prairie bird species. All sites are located within the Metro Conservation Corridors, and are situated adjacent to or near other protected properties. At each site, we will also engage the public through volunteer restoration events.

In addition, the both crossings receive a significant amount of erosion due to inadequate road grading and ditching. The eroded sediment degrades habitat for trout spawning and nursery conditions. The primary activities of this grant would be to improve fish habitat by replacing the 2 crossings and reduce erosion into the streams with erosion control methods. Funding currently in place from Cook SWCD's GLC grant will be used for the roadway erosion control methods and would be used as match to the culvert replacements.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44.807497,-93.578308

2554213,Montevideo Dam Removal,2012,100000,,,,,,,,,,,,City of Montevideo,,The Montevideo dam is located on the Chippewa River one mile upstream of the Minnesota River in Montevideo. The dam frequently prevents natural migrations by native aquatic organisms between upstream and downstream habitats. The dam has also caused degradation of upstream habitats by causing the channel to widen and sedimentation of riffles to occur. This project involves removal of the dam and partially replacing it with a constructed rock rapids. This will reconnect 12 miles of the Chippewa River up to the next major barrier which is the Watson-Sag diversion dam. The rock rapids is necessary to provide grade control because the river has been channelized downstream of the dam and would severely erode upstream without the rapids. The Montevideo dam frequently floods out during high flows and is not a barrier to Asian carp.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,44.948605,-95.729963

As part of the WPA purchase agreement, the Service acknowledged the seller's right to maintain the tile system through the WPA but reserved the right to modify them in a manner that would allow the drained wetland to be restored while maintaining upstream drainage functions. With relatively new developments in materials and installation techniques (i.e., non-perforated plastic tile and GPS technology) the ability to successfully accomplish this wetland restoration project has been greatly enhanced. Utilizing the CPL program as a primary funding mechanism, Minnesota Waterfowl Association desires to assist the Service in accomplishing this long-overdue wetland restoration project. The subject wetland basin is approximately four acres in size and is currently dominated by reed canary grass, an undesirable invasive grass species that is commonly found in moist soil areas. The tract includes a few additional small pothole wetlands that were restored by the Service shortly after it was purchased as a WPA. Although much of the WPA consists of upland grasses, Grove Creek and its floodplain (which is tributary to the Crow River) is an important wildlife habitat feature on the eastern portion of the unit.

Water?s edge habitat and erosion control is an important management need for the Rum River. We will use cedar tree revetments to enhance shore habitat and correct erosion on 1,500 linear-feet of mild to moderately eroding riverbank. 40 landowners expressed interest in response to outreach on 1/9th of the river corridor. We will select sites with preference for creating contiguous habitat particularly adjacent to protected land and stabilizing riverbanks that are most likely to worsen if left untreated. The Rum River is a state designated Wild, Scenic, and Recreational River, state water trail and popular fishery for smallmouth bass, northern pike and walleye. It has been identified as a regional priority by the Isanti, Mille Lacs and Anoka SWCDs. Furthermore, The Nature Conservancy has identified the Rum River as a key area for habitat and water quality, due in part to the fact that is it a headwaters area for the Mississippi River. Protecting the scenic nature of the river and the fishery necessitates repairing shore habitat and erosion. Bank erosion is prevalent, but much of it is mild or moderate. By applying low-cost ecologically friendly bank stabilization approaches to these sites, we hope to minimize the long-term need for costly armament that is often necessary to correct severe erosion. Cedar tree revetments are ideal because the trees are readily available for little or no cost, they can be planned without extensive engineered designs, installation requires simple hand tools and little specialized expertise, they can be installed in sites inaccessible with large equipment, and the installation results in no collateral site damage or associated restoration cost. The technique utilizes Eastern Red Cedar trees, which are naturally rot resistant and are considered invasive in prairie landscapes. Cedar trees are anchored along an eroding stream bank. The trees? dense branches create a flexible armor and habitat network for fish and invertebrates. Sediment is often deposited within the revetment, helping to stabilize the toe of the bank and build a suitable area for plants such as sedges to grow. Live willow or dogwood stakes are often added among the cedar trees to accelerate the revegetation process. By the time the revetment trees have decayed in 10+ years, the bank is often stabilized by the roots of the living vegetation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,45.21996,-93.390337

It is part of a network of four planned carp barriers. Funding for the other three is sought through a traditional DNR CPL grant application. The two applications should be considered a linked package. The carp barrier network will: (a) Prevent seasonal carp migration between favored spawning areas (Typo Lake and tributary creeks) and overwintering areas (Martin Lake), thereby reducing their population. (b) Make commercial carp harvests more effective by preventing escape to surrounding waterbodies and recolonization after harvest. Carp have significant impacts on these lakes by degrading aquatic habitat, replacing game fish biomass and reducing water quality. Martin and Typo Lakes are most strongly impacted and largely devoid of aquatic vegetation. Martin, Typo and Linwood Lakes are all impaired for excess nutrients. Their TMDL plans* cite managing carp as important to lake restoration. Downstream waterbodies including the Sunrise River and St. Croix River are degraded and high priorities. The one barrier requested in this application is located between Martin and Island Lakes, and will prevent carp movement between the two. While carp do not commonly travel this route now, they may do so when other travel routes are blocked by barriers. In this way, this barrier is important to the overall management approach. An ideal carp barrier location exists: a six foot diameter road crossing culvert in the stream connecting Island to Martin Lake. This constriction point assures a reliable barrier. It is within 50 feet of the largest carp source (Martin Lake) and affords protection to the greatest possible upstream area.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,45.376745,-93.08842

Cedar tree revetments are ideal because the trees are readily available for little or no cost, they can be planned without extensive engineered designs, installation requires simple hand tools and little specialized expertise, they can be installed in sites inaccessible with large equipment, and the installation results in no collateral site damage or associated restoration cost. The technique utilizes Eastern Red Cedar trees, which are naturally rot resistant and are considered invasive in prairie landscapes. Cedar trees are anchored along an eroding stream bank. The trees? dense branches create a flexible armor and habitat network for fish and invertebrates. Sediment is often deposited within the revetment, helping to stabilize the toe of the bank and build a suitable area for plants such as sedges to grow. Live willow or dogwood stakes are often added among the cedar trees to accelerate the revegetation process. By the time the revetment trees have decayed in 10+ years, the bank is often stabilized by the roots of the living vegetation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,45.402365,-93.357393

In 1996, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR), Fisheries Section, in cooperation with the WBLA, added rock and gravel of appropriate size for Walleye spawning in an area approximately 250 feet within Gizzard Creek. Follow up monitoring indicated that Walleye and White Sucker used the newly created spawning habitat. A recent inspection of the site showed that silt has filled in most of the available spawning habitat and significant streambank erosion exists in the area. An enhancement of this site will include updated methods for a self-cleaning spawning riffle and re-establishing a stream bank using bank stabilization methods. Increased streambank stability and in-channel restorations will benefit other recreational use of the lake by reducing sediment and nutrient inputs in the lake.. MNDNR will provide technical assistance on the methods, design and placement of the spawning riffle. The WOTSWCD will provide the technical knowledge and assistance on bank stabilization methods.

The new structure design will mimic natural stream hydraulics and effectively restore connectivity and stability to the stream with minimal maintenance. The design is based off a natural channel design method pioneered by Dave Rosgen P.H., Ph.D. and successfully tested by DNR Division of Ecological Resources Stream Habitat Program on 17 dam replacement projects. Upon completion, this project will improve biological health and stability in the stream and Big Pine Lake, it will also help protect three state listed fish species. All three were identified in surveys downstream of the dam (DNR)and risk population declines if the dam remains. Dams sever connections to resources essential for migratory fish and aquatic organisms, and compromise stream health and stability (Reconnecting Rivers. MNDNR. 2010). This project will help increase the numbers of these species and other aquatic species as passage and connectivity is restored between Big Pine Lake, the Pine River, tributaries, and ultimately the Mississippi. This will greatly benefit migratory fish, mussels, and numerous aquatic organisms. The positive effects will be direct and immediate to the aquatic plant and animal communities that inhabit or utilize more than 20 miles of the river and 400 acres of Big Pine lake, essentially reversing decades of impacts. Over time this will also improve fisheries and habitat in the upper Mississippi and tributaries. The Pine River is located in Crow Wing County in the heart of North Central Minnesota?s lake country. It flows from the north into the Whitefish Chain of Lakes and out at the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) dam located in Crosslake, MN. The river is a State designated water trail used by canoers, kayakers, and anglers. Grant funds for this project will help protect resources in the county that attract more than 125,000 tourists a year and provide recreational and work opportunities for the 62,700 permanent CWC residents. Furthermore, the project will help to maintain the $219 million CWC tourism industry based on high quality lakes, public accesses, and fisheries that benefit Minnesotans and non-resident tourists (Tourism Minnesota 2014).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,46.635622,-94.091599

We propose to modify this existing dam by installing a rock arch rapids fishway, which will improve safety, opportunities for recreation, fish and wildlife habitat and dispersal, and provide a permanent fix to the aging dam. A rock arch rapids fishway is a structure that mimics shallow natural waterfalls in rivers that can be traversed by fish moving up and downstream from the falls (see attached photo of a fishway [Dunton Locks] just upstream from Pelican Lake). While modification of the dam into rock rapids will benefit all aquatic species moving along the river, this structure will be particularly usefully in aiding the DNR's goal of reintroduction of sturgeon, a fish that is native to the Red River basin, but has been absent since the mid-1900s. In an effort to reestablish sturgeon, the DNR began stocking them in Detroit Lake in 1997, upstream from Pelican and Fish Lakes, and the rock arch rapids would create suitable spawning habitat for them. Even though this project covers less than one acre of land, it will benefit the 14,790 acres of lakes and 84 river miles in the entire Pelican River Watershed by restoring connections that existed prior to dam building (see attached map).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,46.673911,-96.020191
