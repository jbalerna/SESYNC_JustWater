",,"Activity 1 Complete design and all permit requirements for a ""sweeping"" electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1. The MN DNR believed that the best approach to keep Invasive Carp out of the upper Mississippi River watershed was to close the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock. The lock is administered by the US Army Corps of Engineers and required an act of Congress to shut down. Minnesota senators and representatives successfully added an amendment to the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) that called for Upper St. Anthony Falls lock closure within one year of passage of the bill. The bill passed both chambers of the federal legislature and was signed into law by President Obama on June 10, 2014. Lock closure happened June 10, 2015.   Prior to lock closure, the MN DNR initiated an invasive carp deterrent project at Lock and Dam 1 based on the status of carp population at the time and the uncertain political will to close a federal lock.  The DNR contracted with Smith-Root Inc. to design an electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1.  With the passage of the 2014 WRRDA bill, construction of a Lock and Dam 1 barrier was not necessary. But, due to the timing of passage of the bill, there was no cost savings by terminating the design contract for the electrical barrier. Also, by completing the design, the MN DNR has a better understanding of the costs, potential effectiveness, and safety concerns associated with this technology. The contractor submitted a final design to the DNR in 2014. Activity 2 Complete design, acquire permits, and construct deterrent barriers in Minnesota's portion of the Missouri River watershed. Waters in the southwest corner of Minnesota were vulnerable to Invasive Carp expansion from the Missouri River watershed. MN DNR fisheries identified locations to prevent Invasive carp from entering Minnesota waters and from entering the Mississippi River and Minnesota River tributaries through watershed breaches. • Okabena Creek - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR acquired a flowage easement and removed two road culverts. With these culverts removed, the township gravel road acts as a physical berm to separate the watersheds. • Okabena Creek Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier by removing two small culverts and installing a 12 foot by 6 foot electrified culvert. The barrier prevents upstream movement of fish. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Soil and Water Conservation District and a private landowner to build up an earthen dike berm to disconnect the watersheds. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Highway Department and the Minnesota Department of Transportation to install a grate system and tile line caps to prevent fish from moving across a watershed boundary via the tile line system. • Minnesota River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Little Sioux River - Rock River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch and an outlet structure was modified to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Illinois Lake Protective Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier on a WMA downstream of the outlet of Illinois Lake. Activity 3 Develop cost share agreement with State of Iowa to construct barrier at Lower Gar Outlet. A joint powers agreement with Iowa DNR was executed to help share costs on a barrier to prevent Invasive Carp in the Missouri River watershed from entering Minnesota. An electric barrier at the outlet of Lower Gar Lake became fully operational in December 2012. Activity 4 Complete evaluation on feasibility of barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The Minnesota River is a free flowing system whose watershed covers much of southern Minnesota. The MN DNR contracted with the Water Resource Center at Minnesota State - Mankato on a project to evaluate several Minnesota River aspects including barrier feasibility.  Increasing the understanding of this system aided the DNR in evaluating deterrent barrier potential on the Minnesota River and its tributaries. Additionally, the project provided information on habitat suitability and described the Minnesota/Red River connection.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in July 2018. Activity 5 Implement and evaluate deterrent barriers at Lock and Dams. The susceptible portion of the St. Croix River is not conducive to electrical barriers due to the high level of recreational use (safety concerns) and the required cooperation from Wisconsin, which has expressed limited to no interest in constructing a barrier. The best alternative is exploring deterrent technologies in lock(s) below the confluence with the Mississippi River. The MN DNR contracted with the Minnesota Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center to evaluate the potential effectiveness of flow modifications and an existing acoustic deterrent in Mississippi River Lock and Dam 8 to prevent Invasive Carp movement.   A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in March 2019. Activity 6 Complete design, acquire permits and construct deterrent barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The uncertainty associated with a barrier (effectiveness, timeline, cost, native community impacts, and ability to construct) on the Minnesota River was high.  This was substantiated by the evaluation completed by Minnesota State Mankato (Activity 4).  Given this scenario, DNR Fisheries identified high value aquatic resources that could be protected at locations in tributaries.  Construction of the two electric barriers, Madison/Eagle lakes protective barrier and Elysian/Buffalo lakes protective barrier, were completed in February 2019. Activity 7 Lock and Dam 5 Acoustic Deterrent Feasibility Study Mississippi River Lock and Dam 5 was identified as a potential location for installation of an acoustic barrier to deter upstream movement of Invasive Carp.  Before any potential construction project, the DNR required a feasibility study to estimate the effectiveness, construction costs, and annual operation/maintenance costs.  The MN DNR contracted with the University of Minnesota-Duluth to complete the study.  Study results suggest further development of the technology was needed before deployment at this site.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in December 2018.   ",7/1/2012,11/4/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Nick,Frohnauer,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5670,nick.frohnauer@state.mn.us,"Grants/Contracts, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Blue Earth, Cottonwood, Hennepin, Jackson, Waseca",,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/protect-aquatic-habitat-asian-carp,,,,,43.340711,-95.132619

These forests, which provide critical habitat for forest dependent birds, are under threat from invasive species like reed canary grass. Without active management these forests will continue to decline over time. Our program focused on controlling invasive species and regenerating a variety of tree and shrub species. We prepared sites for planting or natural regeneration using herbicide, disking, or mowing; planted tree seedlings, cottonwood cuttings, or direct seeded; protected trees from deer and voles; improved tree vigor and growth through selective thinning; and controlled weeds (herbicide, mowing) after planting. Our geographic scope included the Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border, and the lower ends of major tributaries. Much of this area included state forest, Wildlife Management Areas, or National Wildlife and Fish Refuge lands. Our priorities were determined in cooperation with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Army Corps of Engineers. All projects were on public lands owned and managed by these agencies. Priorities were based on forest condition and threats, habitat needs, logistics, and access. Our goal was to prevent or control invasive species long enough to establish forest canopy and maintain a diverse forest structure that benefits birds and other wildlife. Our objectives were designed to utilize a variety of enhancement tools, monitor results, and apply that information to designing new projects. A description of each project is provided below. For several sites additional work will be completed with Phase 2 of our floodplain forest enhancement program. At Gores WMA, a 20-acre site north of Red Wing, we completed site preparation, planted bare root seedlings on 10 acres, and completed post planting weed control following tree planting on 10 additional acres that had been previously planted by US Army Corps of Engineers. At the Cannon River Collischan Road Willow Project, a 10-acre site near Red Wing, we treated reed canary grass and cut willow trees along strips to encourage aggressive expansion of willows to prevent reed canary grass encroachment into adjacent high quality floodplain forest. At Dukes Pond, a 22-acre site near Red Wing, we completed site preparation on 15 acres along the edge of existing high quality floodplain forest. Our intention was to plant trees the next fall on the treated area, but unusually high water prevented this from occurring. Bare root seedlings and potted trees had been purchased, so instead of planting the treated areas we planted 7 adjacent acres where DNR Forestry was planning a timber harvest. The planted trees will regenerate when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At North Clear Lake, a 9-acre site north of Red Wing, bare root seedlings were planted in the understory of existing floodplain forest scheduled for harvest by DNR Forestry. The planted trees will give a head start to regeneration when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At East Indian Creek Delta, a 55-acre site north of Weaver, site preparation was completed and tree and shrub seedlings were planted in an area dominated by ash trees. Shade tolerant seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to the death and decline of older trees. At Whitewater Delta, a 51-acre site near Weaver, buckthorn was removed and bare root seedlings and potted trees were planted in an area dominated by ash trees with pockets of reed canary grass. The seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to emerald ash borer impacts on the exiting trees. At Whalen Tract, a 55-acre site just north of the Iowa border, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, and post planting weed control. At Whitewater DNR, a 16-acre site approximately 5 miles upstream of the mouth of the Whitewater River, site preparation and direct seeding were completed. At Cannon River Bottoms State Forest, a 30-acre site near Red Wing, site preparation was completed and tree seedlings and potted trees were planted in open pockets of reed canary grass within existing forest scheduled for harvest. At Root River, a 93-acre site near La Crescent, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, direct seeding, and post planting weed control. At four of the above sites (Cannon River Collischan Road Willow project, Whitewater DNR, Root River, Whalen Tract) up to 8 acres within or near each site was also treated for reed canary grass and planted with different tree species and stock types. This was part of a LCCMR study evaluating reed canary grass control, and tree survival and growth. Evaluating success will take time. Because trees are slow growing, it can take a decade or longer for them to grow large enough to form a canopy, which will ultimately determine the success of these projects. Preliminary findings indicate initial survival of seedlings was variable. At some sites, post planting observations suggest low survival, however, small seedlings are difficult to locate in the forest understory. First year survival of bare root seedlings at the LCCMR study sites was 80-90%. Survival of potted trees at many sites was good, however there was some damage from deer. Other findings resulting from this grant included: post tree planting weed control and maintenance is essential for tree seedling survival; tree guards and deer repellent are effective at protecting trees from deer and voles; cottonwood cuttings were relatively easy to install and effective at establishing trees; swamp white oak were resilient, relatively fast growing, and resistant to deer browse making them a good choice for these sites; plantings on drier sites, with proper maintenance, take less time to establish than wetter sites; good natural regeneration can occur on some sites after exposing mineral soils; and back-up sites are needed to adjust to flooding situations which may prevent scheduled tree plantings. These findings have been incorporated into project management prescriptions. ",7/1/2014,6/30/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Tim,Schlagenhaft,The National Audubon Society,2000 W.

What were once vast prairies and wetlands is now predominantly an agricultural landscape. The SRRWD is requesting funds to complete the Phase VII Habitat Restoration Program. Our watershed prides itself in working alongside landowners to protect, enhance, and restore wildlife habitat. This project continues our effort to return agricultural landscapes to wetland complexes, enhance stream banks, and permanently protect biological functioning parcels. The results would benefit fish, waterfowl, and wildlife populations and reverse the trend of wetland loss and habitat degradation.","Program Goals:In 2014 the SRRWD created a phased, $20 million approach to restore, protect, and enhance degraded habitat conditions by implementing projects on a lake-shed basis. The Watershed Habitat Restoration Program is designed to accomplish the following objectives: •Remove rough fish species and restore desirable fish, waterfowl and wildlife populations•Enhance native aquatic rooted vegetation•Increase fish habitat and spawning areas and waterfowl nesting areas•Improve waterfowl breeding and migratory success•Restore stream banks and increase wildlife habitat and its natural prairie•Increase and improve community use of restored natural resources and protect the watershed from invasive species. Our program will also interconnect and reestablish important flyway habitats within Minnesota. Once completed, the program will establish waterfowl and fish populations, increase habitat for wetland dependent wildlife, and create the wildlife mecca that was recorded in the late 1800’s. Specifically, Phase VII of the program will contribute to these goals by:•Acquiring 37 acres of key targeted lands to reestablish native vegetation, protect land along the Shell Rock River, and improve nesting habitat and waterfowl food sources.•Restoring 60 acres of agricultural land into wetland basins to improve upland game and waterfowl nesting habitat.•Enhancing 15 acres of the Shell Rock River to improve instream habitat and vegetation management creating more productive, self-sustaining fisheries. The program includes projects that are prioritized on the significance of the benefits to aquatic habitat, urgency of the work, availability of leverage funds, location of projects and agreements with relevant planning documents. The SRRWD has a proven track record with the LSOHC and implementing projects that protect, restore and enhance natural resources. The SRRWD continues to receive strong support for these projects from landowners, local governments and sporting organizations. This proposal uses a programmatic approach to achieve prioritized habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement of lakes, wetlands and streams across the Watershed to once again create the wildlife mecca. Finally, this program will preserve an outdoor legacy for Minnesotans to use and enjoy for generations. Background:The Shell Rock River Watershed District (SRRWD) covers 246 square miles inside Freeborn County and includes a complex system of wetlands, streams, and shallow lakes that drain into the Shell Rock River. Managing habitat for this complex system is imperative to the SRRWD as well as understanding its role for providing critical habitat for fish, waterfowl and wildlife. Habitat degradation of wetlands, streams, and shallow lakes is an issue of statewide importance that requires accelerated investment in projects to reverse this degradation. Protection and restoration of this critical habitat is the highest priority in the SRRWD and is directly affected by invasive aquatic vegetation, land use changes, increased water demands, populations of invasive fish species such as common carp, and artificial drainage. Degradation in habitat is influencing available food sources for game fish populations that include Northern Pike, Bluegill, Yellow Perch and Walleye, and duck populations that include Northern Pintail, Redhead, Canvasback and Lesser Scaup.",,7/1/2018,,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Andy,Henschel,Shell Rock River Watershed District,214 West Main Street ,Albert Lea,MN,56007,(507) 377-5785,andy.henschel@co.freeborn.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,Freeborn,Prairie Region,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/shell-rock-river-watershed-habitat-restoration-program-phase-vii,,,,,43.509084,-93.273132

Sedimentation in Upper Mississippi River (UMR) backwaters and declining UMR floodplain forests are a concern to resource managers, anglers, hunters and recreational users. This proposal includes dredging accumulated sediments from a 15 acre backwater in upper Pool 9 and utilizing that material to bury invasive Reed Canary Grass and enhance topographical diversity on 20 acres of Mississippi River floodplain in support of tree planting and floodplain forest restoration.","Aquatic habitat in backwaters of the UMR are filling due to sedimentation from tributary inputs, altered hydrology and island erosion. Backwaters that historically provided deep water habitat and refuge to fish, reptiles and amphibians have decreased in quantity and quality throughout the UMR. The 15 acre aquatic area in upper Pool 9 to be enhanced by dredging will benefit bluegill, crappie and bass populations. Additionally, the area to be dredged is located in a protected bay adjacent to a public access and will increase year-round angling opportunities for multiple fish species. This is a unique project in that dredged material (silts and clays) will be used beneficially to enhance topographic diversity in support of floodplain forest restoration.Much of the existing floodplain forest in the Upper Pool 9 project area has been declining in coverage over the past several decades. Flat topography, higher groundwater levels caused by impoundment, increased frequency and duration of inundation, and reduced creation of new islands and shoreline have decreased the amount of terrestrial land cover suitable for sustaining forested communities in this area and throughout the UMR floodplain. Furthermore, increased competition from Reed Canary Grass (RCG), an aggressively invasive species whose occurrence is widespread throughout the project area, has adversely affected forest regeneration and altered the natural succession of open areas to forest. Placement of dredged material on a 20 acre area consisting of a monotypic stand of RCG will bury the invasive RCG, increase floodplain elevations by 2 - 3 feet and provide a clean medium for tree planting and direct seeding to restore the floodplain forest community, benefiting SGCN neo-tropical migrant bird species such as Prothonotary and Cerulean warblers.This project directly addresses the systemic issues of floodplain forest loss and habitat fragmentation, and is a priority action item in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) UMR Systemic Forest Management Plan. It incorporates a variety of floodplain forest restoration components such as: increasing tree species diversity; reintroduction of a hard mast component in floodplain forest communities; improving wildlife habitat; incorporation of innovative restoration measures such as the utilization of dredge materials for the purpose of increasing topographic diversity; and invasive species control and management. In addition, the project lends itself to the adaptive management process by incorporating a variety of restoration measures as well as post-project monitoring to measure their effectiveness, thereby informing future floodplain forest restoration efforts. As stated in the report ""Ecological Status and Trends of the Upper Mississippi River System 1998"" (USGS 1999), ""The ecosystem as a whole benefits from floodplain forests. Besides serving as a rich habitat for wildlife and fish during floods; the forests reduce soil erosion, improve water quality and provide a scenic and recreational landscape."" Floodplain forest restoration in this location will allow for direct comparison with other floodplain forest restoration techniques being utilized in adjacent parcels by partner organizations and agencies.

The MN DNR contracted with the Minnesota Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center to evaluate the potential effectiveness of flow modifications and an existing acoustic deterrent in Mississippi River Lock and Dam 8 to prevent Invasive Carp movement.   A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in March 2019. Activity 6 Complete design, acquire permits and construct deterrent barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The uncertainty associated with a barrier (effectiveness, timeline, cost, native community impacts, and ability to construct) on the Minnesota River was high.  This was substantiated by the evaluation completed by Minnesota State Mankato (Activity 4).  Given this scenario, DNR Fisheries identified high value aquatic resources that could be protected at locations in tributaries.  Construction of the two electric barriers, Madison/Eagle lakes protective barrier and Elysian/Buffalo lakes protective barrier, were completed in February 2019. Activity 7 Lock and Dam 5 Acoustic Deterrent Feasibility Study Mississippi River Lock and Dam 5 was identified as a potential location for installation of an acoustic barrier to deter upstream movement of Invasive Carp.  Before any potential construction project, the DNR required a feasibility study to estimate the effectiveness, construction costs, and annual operation/maintenance costs.  The MN DNR contracted with the University of Minnesota-Duluth to complete the study.  Study results suggest further development of the technology was needed before deployment at this site.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in December 2018.   ",7/1/2012,11/4/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Nick,Frohnauer,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5670,nick.frohnauer@state.mn.us,"Grants/Contracts, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Blue Earth, Cottonwood, Hennepin, Jackson, Waseca",,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/protect-aquatic-habitat-asian-carp,,,,,43.520102,-95.294512

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.578063,-91.818771

We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure.

We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley.

Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream.

This effort builds on previous LSOHC funding to control reed canary grass and plant trees as part of a long-term effort.,"The Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border contains some of the largest and most significant tracts of floodplain forest along the entire Upper Mississippi River. These forests and mixed wetlands cover tens of thousands of acres and are especially critical to many species of birds and other wildlife, including wood ducks which use these areas for nesting and feeding.These forests are under threat. While historically diverse in the number, age, and size of tree species, much of the forest now consists of silver maple ranging from 50-70 years old. These trees are expected to live another 50-70 years, after which they will die-off and disappear. Unfortunately, when trees are removed through harvest or die naturally, reed canary grass and other invasive species move in and prevent natural regeneration. This is occurring at a number of locations within the project area, and without aggressive, long-term management these floodplain forests will be greatly reduced or in some locations disappear completely. Floodplain forest regeneration is a slow process taking decades to accomplish. By selectively controlling invasive species following harvest, blowdown, or other events and planting trees the forest can be maintained long-term. Restoring forest at small sites within larger tracts will ensure that a diversity of tree species, sizes, and ages are present. This approach over time will maintain large contiguous blocks of forest and continue to provide habitat for many wildlife species, including rare species like ceruleuan warbler and red-shouldered hawk.This proposal seeks funding to continue implementing floodplain forest restoration and enhancement projects throughout the project area which includes the Mississippi River and lower ends of major tributaries. The number of sites needing enhancement or restoration is extensive and will take many years of consistent work to restore. Sites identified in this proposal range from 20-115 acres in size. All sites are located on public lands within Minnesota state forests, WMA's, Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, or Corps of Engineers owned lands. Each site is threatened by invasive species and natural regeneration of floodplain forest trees is not expected without aggressive management. Funding will be used to control invasive species, especially reed canary grass, using a combination of prescribed burns, mowing or forestry mulching, and herbicide applications. Past efforts to plant seedlings into existing reed canary grass fields have not been successful, so once invasive species are controlled larger-size trees suitable to each site will be planted, or direct seeding or bare root trees may be used to create high densities of seedlings. At some sites, timber stand improvement including removing invasive species like buckthorn will be used to create small openings for diversifying forest species and age structure. Deer protection will be provided for planted trees when needed. Vole guards will be installed on the larger planted trees. This combination will allow the trees to establish and over time develop a canopy that limits or prevents invasive species and maintains the overall diversity of the forest.Priority sites were determined in conjunction with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Corps of Engineers foresters and wildlife managers and are locations under serious threat of losing the floodplain forest. All of the sites are on public lands open to hunting and fishing. Three of the sites are listed with limited hunting access. These are within areas closed to waterfowl hunting on the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge. They are open to all legal hunting during other times of the year.

This 257 acre parcel will now be a Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Aquatic Management Area (AMA) guided by an Aquatic Management Plan.,,"The Shell Rock River Watershed District (SRRWD) Management Plan developed in 2004, revised in 2015, has identified goals for accelerating programs for improved habitat, water quality and flood control. Acquiring the 257 acre parcel allowed the SRRWD to meet these goals by protecting such a large portion of undeveloped habitat and opening opportunities for the public by incorporating recreation, hunting, and fishing into the property. This project was time sensitive, as it was an essential step in securing access for the replacement of the Albert Lea Lake Dam. The Albert Lea Lake Dam and Fish Barrier Project was also funded by the LSOHC and was a 3-in-1 project designed to replace the failing dam and install a draw down structure that provided vegetation and game fish management, an electric fish barrier for protection from aquatic invasive species, and provided an aesthetically appealing rock arch dam. This project complements the 257 headwaters purchase as the water from the outlet of the dam continues to flow south through the middle of the property that was purchased. The 257 acre parcel has various natural amenities that includes the headwaters and 1.4 miles of the Shell Rock River, floodplain and mesic hardwood forests, undisturbed highly diversified wetland complexes and a riparian and stream bank corridor that is a mile long and approximately ½ mile wide. A majority of the site has undisturbed native plant communities, but some locations have been mined for sand and gravel, and roughly 43 acres of this property was used for row crops. After the purchase of the property the SRRWD, using the MnDNR recommendations, seeded the cropland into native grasses and wildflowers, and once the gravel lease is up, the MnDNR will incorporate that portion into wetland ponds. With the cropland and gravel pit restored, it creates a 257 parcel habitat niche in a predominantly agricultural setting that is at pre-settlement conditions. The Shell Rock River Water District was the fiscal agent that received the funds for purchase of this property. The process of this reimbursable grant was a relatively simple process that is well executed by LSOHC Staff and Council Members. The property is now in the process of being transferred into an AMA. This DNR management and appraisal process took longer than the District proposed because of the cumbersome DNR requirements. Once fully transferred, the DNR will have regulations for public use of this land as well as maintaining restored conditions.

The benefits from this project include improved aquatic and waterfowl habitat, invasive species management, and improved desirable fish populations.","The Shell Rock River Watershed District (SRRWD) encompasses 246-square miles in Freeborn County. The District includes 11 lakes that drain to the Shell Rock River, which flows into the Cedar River. Among the District’s lakes are Fountain Lake and Albert Lea Lake, located within the City of Albert Lea. These lakes are central to Albert Lea’s tourism industry and its identity.The previous Albert Lea Lake outlet structure and access bridge, installed in 1922, was in need of repair. The Albert Lea Lake Management and Invasive Species Control Project replaced the fixed-crest dam with a rock-arch rapids feature to control water levels. A lake level management structure was also constructed, as well as an electric fish barrier to prevent silver, bighead, and common carp and other benthic feeding fish from entering the lake.The project is expected to result in improved aquatic habitat, improved waterfowl nesting, breeding, and feeding habitat, an increase in desirable fish populations, and improved water quality and clarity for years to come. Specific benefits are outlined below.1. Rock-Arch Water-Level Control: The SRRWD replaced the old fixed-crest dam with a series of rock arches to provide a naturalized outlet to Albert Lea Lake. The upper-most rock arch is controlling the normal water level with the help of metal sheeting. There are two more rock arches behind the first, totaling 3 rock arches. 2.  Lake Level Management Structure: The installation of the structure to facilitate lake-level management gives the SRRWD flexibility to take action benefiting the health of the lake. Periodic lowering of lake elevations allows maximum in-lake sediment compaction, improvement of water clarity due to reduction in wind-generated turbidity, and time for plant colonization of shoreline and shallow-water areas. The resulting improvement in aquatic plant health benefits the entire lake system.3.  Electric fish barrier:  An electric fish barrier was installed and is used to reduce the population of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Albert Lea Lake and to prevent the introduction of Bighead and Silver (Asian) Carp. Common carp uproot and consume aquatic vegetation, disturb and re-suspend phosphorous-rich sediments. The resulting increase in turbidity reduces light penetration—discouraging rooted plant growth—and contributes to algal blooms responsible for oxygen depletion. The destruction of aquatic vegetation by large populations of foraging fish also impacts waterfowl nesting, breeding, and feeding habitat, shoreline and littoral habitat, and game fish spawning habitat.Design and engineering of the project started in late 2013. Contracts and associated agreements for the dam were made in early 2014. The order of operations for the construction of the project includes:•    Installation of the cofferdam•    Construction of the water diversion channel•    Removal of the old dam and bridge•    Installation of the metal sheeting that holds the lake level•    Placement of the first rock arch along the sheeting•    Installation of the footings for the concrete work•    Concrete work for the fish barrier•    Concrete work for the draw down structure•    Finalize/seal all concrete•    Placement of remaining rock arches•    Removal of the cofferdam and water diversion channel•    Installation and fine tuning of the fish barrier componentThe main construction of the projects where completed in the spring of 2015. At the end of 2015, some calibrations of the electric components were needed on the electric fish barrier. After the ice melt in the spring of 2016, those changes were made to fine tune the barrier. The Albert Lea Lake Management and Invasive Species Control Structure is now fully complete. The outlet, fish passage, and fish barrier worked in harmonization as part of the District’s overall management plan. Similar to the Wedge Creek, White Lake, and Mud Lake efforts, the anticipated outcome for Albert Lea Lake is restoration of rooted aquatic vegetation, fish and wildlife habitat, and enhanced water quality—all of which will serve to increase community use of this important recreational resource.   The existing Albert Lea Lake outlet structure and access bridge, installed in 1922, are in need of repair.The proposed project would replace the fixed-crest dam with a rock-arch rapids feature to control water levels and allow fish passage (see concept drawing).

It has been identified as a high priority in the SRRWD Management Plan, developed with public participation, and subject to public review and approval by the SRRWD Board. Specific benefits are outlined below. 1.  Rock-Arch Water-Level Control and Fish Passage: Replacing the existing fixed-crest dam with a series of rock arches will provide a naturalized outlet to Albert Lea Lake, with the upper-most rock arch controlling the normal water level. The arches will also provide fish passage, allowing northern pike to move upstream from the Shell Rock River to spawn in the lake. Northern Pike typically spawn in March and April, while carp spawning/movement typically does not start until May. A fish passage—in combination with an electric fish barrier activated in May to preclude carp—will increase the population of Northern Pike, natural predators of carp. Albert Lea Lake populations of Northern Pike and Bluegill (also a carp egg predator) are currently below Minnesota DNR norms for similar lakes. 2.  Lake Level Management Structure: Installation of a structure to facilitate lake-level management gives the SRRWD flexibility to take action benefiting the health of the lake. Periodic lowering of lake elevations allows maximum in-lake sediment compaction, improvement of water clarity due to reduction in wind-generated turbidity, and time for plant colonization of shoreline and shallow-water areas.

The resulting increase in turbidity reduces light penetration—discouraging rooted plant growth—and contributes to algal blooms responsible for oxygen depletion. The destruction of aquatic vegetation by large populations of foraging fish also impacts waterfowl nesting, breeding, and feeding habitat, shoreline and littoral habitat, and game fish spawning habitat. Asian Carp multiply rapidly and are voracious eaters, depleting food resources. The leaping ability of the Silver Carp also poses a danger to boaters and skiers. According to a 2010 news story in the Cedar Rapids Gazette, Asian carp have migrated past the 5-in-1 Dam in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, moving up the Cedar River to Black Hawk County—where the Cedar and the Shell Rock River join. The distance from this point to Albert Lea Lake is only about 100 miles. While there is not general agreement about the threat posed by Asian carp in lake waters, if this does become a concern the barrier could be used year-round and an alternative fish management plan developed. The SRRWD has a proven track record of success with fish barriers. The fish barriers upstream of Albert Lea Lake—at Wedge Creek and White Lake (partially funded by 2009 Outdoor Heritage Funds) and Mud Lake—have improved habitat and water clarity in the upstream areas. Improved habitat is demonstrated by increased sightings of aquatic fur bearers and waterfowl, with 15 waterfowl species sighted during the fall migration. Improvements in water clarity are demonstrated by secchi disk readings on Fountain Lake (connected to these water bodies), which were the best on record in 2010. The proposed outlet, fish passage, and fish barrier will work as part of the District’s overall management plan. Similar to the Wedge Creek, White Lake, and Mud Lake efforts, the anticipated outcome for Albert Lea Lake is restoration of rooted aquatic vegetation, fish and wildlife habitat, and enhanced water quality—all of which will serve to increase community use of this important recreational resource. The strategy of carp/rough fish control and exclusion is known to be effective. This program is endorsed by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Fishery and Wildlife Divisions and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and conducted with their technical assistance and cooperation. This project is consistent with recommendations of the 2004 Shell Rock River Watershed Management Plan (Appendix B & J). It is also noted in the Albert Lea Lake Management Plan, as part of the Freeborn County Comprehensive Water Plan 2006-2015. Other applicable plans include the Minnesota Conservation and Preservation Plan Phase II provisions that address the control of invasive species, restoration of shallow lakes, water quality improvements in impaired waters, and  protection and enhancement of fish and waterfowl breeding habitat (pg. 30-96); and the 2009 Minnesota State Management Plan for Invasive Species. Activities are also within the goals of the Basin Alliance for the Lower Mississippi in Minnesota (BALMM). This project is a component of the 2011 Restoring Native Habitat/Water Quality to the Shell Rock River Project funded by the Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Fund for the fee-title acquisition of the headwaters of the Shell Rock River.

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach.

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,43.62227,-91.863784

This multi-phase plan will restore and enhance a 1,200+ acre fishery, including lakes (1,141 acres), stream, floodplain, wetland and upland habitat restorations. The plan will benefit fish, waterfowl and other wildlife species as well as provide educational opportunities for the community. ","The Fairmont Chain of Lakes are positioned within the heart of the City of Fairmont, appropriately nicknamed The City of Lakes. The five lakes flow from South to North and are all connected by streams and channels. Fairmont has a population of 10,000 and is the County Seat of Martin County which has a population of 20,000. Martin County has 49 named lakes and 20 + unnamed lakes. The lakes are used for recreation, with the most popular activities being hunting and fishing. The Fairmont Chain of Lakes are the most popular lakes for recreation and are critical to the local economy. The City of Fairmont is partnering with Martin Soil and Water Conservation District, The Fairmont Lakes Foundation, DNR Fish and Wildlife, and the Martin County Conservation Alliance to restore and reconnect two floodplain wetlands along Dutch Creek, which flows into the Fairmont Chain of Lakes. The basins will be restored with adjustable wetland hydrology and seeding with native wetland vegetation. The upland areas will be seeded with native prairie plant species, including local source ecotype, to benefit pollinator species. A diversion weir and cross vanes allowing for fish passage will be installed in the Creek to divert flow into the wetland basins. This will allow for adjustable water levels within the wetland to ensure Northern Pike are able to spawn and to exclude Carp access and spawning.The project will provide the largest, highest quality spawning habitat within the Fairmont Chain of Lakes Watershed. Previously usable spawning habitat has been degraded due to development, drainage and loss of connectivity of the floodplain wetlands to the Chain of Lakes. Due to loss and degradation of suitable spawning habitat, the Fairmont Chain of Lakes has had a significant decrease in the Northern Pike (Apex Predator) population. This has allowed the Invasive Carp and Yellow Bass populations to grow rapidly. This shallow lake system, located in Southern Minnesota, is a critical part of the Fairmont economy and is a place where many in Martin County, and the region, go to recreate. The fishery has been in decline as it has lost its balance without a healthy Northern Pike population. The DNR would like to improve habitat for native species, and the Northern Pike.By restoring and reconnecting the floodplain wetlands with the stream and lake, the primary benefit will be the restoration of critical Northern Pike spawning habitat. Intentionally, there will be a host of secondary benefits to restoring these wetlands. Martin County has a heavily studied population of the Blanding’s Turtle, which is on the State’s Rare and Threatened Species Lists. Additionally, this area will benefit other amphibious species, waterfowl and other local wildlife species.

This includes over 7 miles of stream frontage. Three new Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) were created around the fee acquisitions, opening up 1,505 acres of habitat to public recreation. Restoration or enhancement work was completed on 225 acres of bluff prairies and forests, much of it on lands protected through this program. ",,"In it's proposal, this project identified three primary components: 1) fee title acquisition of priority parcels, 2) restoration and enhancement of prairie and forest habitat in important complexes of protected habitat, and 3) the strategic protection of high-quality habitat on private lands through the acquisition of conservation easements. Work done using this appropriation accomplished all three of those objectives. The Nature Conservancy used funds from this appropriation in acquiring 1,505 acres of land in fee from three landowners. These acquisition have all been transferred to the MN DNR Division of Fish and Wildlife, creating three new management units know as 7 Springs, Rush Creek Woods, and Choice Wildlife Management Area (WMA). This new public land protects over 7 miles of trout stream frontage, along with important forest and bluff prairie habitat. TNC worked closely with DNR Wildlife in prioritizing and acquiring all three of these units, and performing important restoration and enhancement work after acquisition. The size and cost of these acquisitions and the time frames provided by the sellers, it was necessary for the Conservancy to use $2,106,000 of private funds to complete the largest acquisition.  Restoration and enhancement through this appropriation focused primarily on projects on acquired tracts, where TNC restored 44 acres of forest and enhanced 100 acres of forest and 81 acres of prairie. TNC worked with DNR staff, Conservation Corps MN, and local contractors to remove encroaching brush from large bluff prairies and oak savanna on Choice and Rush Creek Woods WMAs. We also treated invasive species in fire-dependent oak woods surrounding prairie areas, allowing prescribed fire in the future to manage larger areas and maintain the diverse transition zone that includes prairie, savanna and oak forest. One burn has already occurred at Rush Creek Woods, and another is planned for Choice WMA this spring to follow up on these enhancement projects. Several floodplain crop fields included on Choice WMA were restored to mesic hardwood forests. These fields were planted through direct seeding in order to provide the best chance of having sufficient seedlings survive the expected impacts of deer browsing.  The Minnesota Land Trust (MLT) used funds from this appropriation to acquire conservation easements from three landowners, totaling 630 acres. These protected acres include dry bluff prairie, oak savanna and woodlands, and mesic hardwood forests. A mile and a half of undeveloped shoreline was also protected along designated trout streams and tributaries. One easement in particular, East Indian Creek, was the key final piece to solidifying a protected corridor running from McCarthy WMA all the way through to Whitewater WMA, linking together over 28,000 acres of protected land.  MLT strategically concentrated its land protection activities on high priority upland habitats, including bluff prairies, forests, savanna and high quality trout streams. MLT targeted private lands that helped fill gaps in the existing protected land framework, contained the highest-quality habitat, and provided the greatest leverage to the state. The Land Trust sought donated easement value in these areas whenever possible but purchased easements that help complete key complexes as necessary. This was the first grant in Southeast Minnesota where MLT transitioned to a competitive, market-based approach to identifying and securing conservation easements. This approach proved to be effective, leveraging $138,800, or 14% of MLT's total appropriation. Working closely with partners was key to the success of this program. Both TNC and MLT worked with other local stakeholders including Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs), DNR staff from multiple agencies, local contractors, and landowners in identifying opportunities, prioritizing projects, and completing them effectively. The collaboration built through this effort continues to benefit ongoing work funded through LSOHC and helps inform other conservation initiatives, such as local water planning and habitat monitoring carried out by other entities. TNC and MLT are committed to staying engaged in Southeast Minnesota and continuing the successful work of this partnership.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.642583,-92.102516

Non-OHF funds were applied to complete feasibility and design in order to optimize application of construction funds. The resulting sheltered bay provides critical coastal wetland habitat for many species of fish and wildlife that utilize the St. Louis River estuary. Wild rice was also established in the bay after construction as part of the separate Wild Rice Restoration Project.Prior to restoration activities, wood waste covered almost the entire open-water portion of the bay. Wood waste was also present under areas of emergent vegetation. Depth of wood waste ranged from 0.2 feet to 3.3 feet. The average water depth was approximately one foot. Although the bay was relatively shallow, submergent and emergent vegetation were only present along the perimeter of the bay. Shallow water depths also limited ecological function of the bay as well as its recreational value to anglers and other boaters.Approximately 115,000 cubic yards of wood waste and wood sediment mixes were removed from Radio Tower Bay. The material was pumped to a dewatering site on US Steel property and was beneficially reused to restore their Superfund site after remediation. The Project resulted in increasing the average water depth of the bay from one foot to 3.7 feet and increased the maximum depth from 2.3 feet to 7.4 feet. A 5.5-acre area with an average water depth of 7.5 feet and channel depth of 5.0 feet will act as a connection between the St. Louis River and the bay, which creates off-river, overwintering fish habitat and improves access for boaters. The bed of Radio Tower Bay is now composed of native silt, unconsolidated organic matter, and clay substrates that have been exposed by the removal of wood waste. Wild Rice was seeded in approximately 15 acres of Radio Tower Bay in 2015 and 2016. Previously seeding areas will be reseeded in 2017 if necessary.All objectives were met and all construction activities went as planned. The technique to grind up wood and sediment mixes and hydraulically pump them to a dewatering facility for drying was revolutionary. The resulting clean organic material was deemed highly desirable as a substrate to restore remediated areas on the US Steel Superfund Site. After removal of material, the dewatering facility will continue to function and will be used to dewater wood waste from Mud Lake (ML2018 OHF proposal), which will substantially reduce the cost of the project.Knowlton CreekThe Knowlton Creek Watershed Project restored and enhanced approximately 6,500 linear feet of cold-water stream habitat using Natural Channel Design techniques. Construction outcomes were successful in eliminating erosion and transport of sediment along all reaches restored. Brook trout migration was established or enhanced along 3,000 feet of the stream (the remaining length was too steep). The Project was completed after Spirit Mountain Recreation Area constructed water control structures at the base of their ski hill to transport excess runoff away from Knowlton Creek and directly to the estuary through the pipe used to transport water from the estuary for snow making. This was a revolutionary partnership and methodology. The Project was designed through a MNDNR/USACE partnership with no OHF funding. The restoration methodology applied was a geomorphologic approach appropriate for the hydrology following the Natural Channel Design methodology (Applied River Morphology, Rosgen, 1996).Construction of in-stream structures (boulder jam steps, boulder jam riffles, toe wood, pocket pools and log vanes with boulder hooks) will improve aquatic habitat diversity and stabilize the bed. Native upland grasses and forbes were planted as well as approximately 15,000 trees along the riparian corridor. During construction, MNDNR, Stantech, Veit/Cardno’s field staff worked together to compile construction observation reports and note deviations from the site plans. Overall, the project implementation partners were very effective at addressing project level circumstances. There were a number of design changes that resulted from conditions encountered in the field. Coordination with project partners such as the City of Duluth, Cloquet Pumping Station, Spirit Mountain, MNDOT, private landowners, as well as, resource professionals within the MNDNR, MPCA and USACE was key to the success of the project. In some instances, earlier coordination of the more critical elements of the project would have eliminated some of the additional implementation time needed to complete the restoration.21st Ave W/Interstate IslandThe scope of Interstate Island was to restore colonial waterbird nesting and young rearing habitat through the addition of sand and gravel, vegetation management, and management of the ring-billed population, thereby contributing to implementation of Actions 1.32 and 1.361 in the Recovery Plan for the Great Lakes Piping Plover. Reproductive success of Common Terns nesting on Interstate Island was degraded due to the low elevation of part of the island, vegetation encroachment, and competition for nesting space from ring-billed gulls.The Project was designed by MNDNR with no OHF funding. The contractor placed 730 linear feet of temporary silt fencing, 3,276 cubic yards of clean beach sand, 610 cubic yards of cobble rip-rap, 28 cubic yards of surface amendments (pebbles & gravel), and 620 linear feet of sediment control log. MN & WDNR staff and volunteers removed all fenced gull exclosures and string grids prior to construction. These were replaced in spring of 2016 as part of regular departmental Piping Plover/Common Tern monitoring and management efforts. Common Terns have been successfully using the enhanced habitat since the Project was completed.Wild Rice (Rask Bay)A total of 133 acres of wild rice was restored at several locations in the St. Louis River estuary in 2015 and 2016. Previously seeded location were reseeded in 2017 as needed. Additionally, WDNR and the MN Land Trust restored 83 acres of wild rice beds on the Wisconsin side of the estuary.

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.655778,-92.052626

",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,43.660026,-91.589771

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.66033,-91.786822

This includes over 7 miles of stream frontage. Three new Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) were created around the fee acquisitions, opening up 1,505 acres of habitat to public recreation. Restoration or enhancement work was completed on 225 acres of bluff prairies and forests, much of it on lands protected through this program. ",,"In it's proposal, this project identified three primary components: 1) fee title acquisition of priority parcels, 2) restoration and enhancement of prairie and forest habitat in important complexes of protected habitat, and 3) the strategic protection of high-quality habitat on private lands through the acquisition of conservation easements. Work done using this appropriation accomplished all three of those objectives. The Nature Conservancy used funds from this appropriation in acquiring 1,505 acres of land in fee from three landowners. These acquisition have all been transferred to the MN DNR Division of Fish and Wildlife, creating three new management units know as 7 Springs, Rush Creek Woods, and Choice Wildlife Management Area (WMA). This new public land protects over 7 miles of trout stream frontage, along with important forest and bluff prairie habitat. TNC worked closely with DNR Wildlife in prioritizing and acquiring all three of these units, and performing important restoration and enhancement work after acquisition. The size and cost of these acquisitions and the time frames provided by the sellers, it was necessary for the Conservancy to use $2,106,000 of private funds to complete the largest acquisition.  Restoration and enhancement through this appropriation focused primarily on projects on acquired tracts, where TNC restored 44 acres of forest and enhanced 100 acres of forest and 81 acres of prairie. TNC worked with DNR staff, Conservation Corps MN, and local contractors to remove encroaching brush from large bluff prairies and oak savanna on Choice and Rush Creek Woods WMAs. We also treated invasive species in fire-dependent oak woods surrounding prairie areas, allowing prescribed fire in the future to manage larger areas and maintain the diverse transition zone that includes prairie, savanna and oak forest. One burn has already occurred at Rush Creek Woods, and another is planned for Choice WMA this spring to follow up on these enhancement projects. Several floodplain crop fields included on Choice WMA were restored to mesic hardwood forests. These fields were planted through direct seeding in order to provide the best chance of having sufficient seedlings survive the expected impacts of deer browsing.  The Minnesota Land Trust (MLT) used funds from this appropriation to acquire conservation easements from three landowners, totaling 630 acres. These protected acres include dry bluff prairie, oak savanna and woodlands, and mesic hardwood forests. A mile and a half of undeveloped shoreline was also protected along designated trout streams and tributaries. One easement in particular, East Indian Creek, was the key final piece to solidifying a protected corridor running from McCarthy WMA all the way through to Whitewater WMA, linking together over 28,000 acres of protected land.  MLT strategically concentrated its land protection activities on high priority upland habitats, including bluff prairies, forests, savanna and high quality trout streams. MLT targeted private lands that helped fill gaps in the existing protected land framework, contained the highest-quality habitat, and provided the greatest leverage to the state. The Land Trust sought donated easement value in these areas whenever possible but purchased easements that help complete key complexes as necessary. This was the first grant in Southeast Minnesota where MLT transitioned to a competitive, market-based approach to identifying and securing conservation easements. This approach proved to be effective, leveraging $138,800, or 14% of MLT's total appropriation. Working closely with partners was key to the success of this program. Both TNC and MLT worked with other local stakeholders including Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs), DNR staff from multiple agencies, local contractors, and landowners in identifying opportunities, prioritizing projects, and completing them effectively. The collaboration built through this effort continues to benefit ongoing work funded through LSOHC and helps inform other conservation initiatives, such as local water planning and habitat monitoring carried out by other entities. TNC and MLT are committed to staying engaged in Southeast Minnesota and continuing the successful work of this partnership.

It is a complex system of shallow lakes, wetlands and streams. Among the District’s lakes are Fountain Lake and Albert Lea Lake, which are located in the heart of Freeborn County. These lakes are central to Albert Lea’s tourism economy and its identity.Degraded habitat of the shallow lakes, wetlands and streams is a conservation issue of statewide importance that requires accelerated investment in projects to restore, enhance and protect habitat for fish, waterfowl and wildlife populations. Protection and restoration of shallow lake habitat is the highest priority in the SRRWD. Reduction of habitat in the watershed is directly affected by surface water, artificial drainage, aquatic vegetation and populations of invasive fish species such as common carp. A decline in habitat is influencing available food sources for duck populations that include Northern Pintail, Redhead, Canvasback, Greater/Lesser Scaup and game fish populations that include Northern Pike, Bluegill, Yellow Perch and Walleye.Projects in the Watershed Habitat Restoration Program are designed to accomplish the following objectives: restore desirable fish, waterfowl and wildlife populations, enhance native aquatic rooted vegetation, increase fish habitat and spawning areas, waterfowl nesting areas, re-establish flyway habitat and increase wildlife habitat and its natural prairie, increase and improve community use of restored natural resources and protect the watershed from invasive species. This will be attained by:• Re-establishing 61 acres of wetland basins to increase food sources and improve waterfowl habitat.• 38 acres in land acquisition to re-establish native vegetation, improve nesting habitat and waterfowl food sources.• Variable crest dam structure installations will maintain and enhance game fish populations, improve waterfowl habitat and establish native vegetation to 620 acres.• Electric fish barrier and water level control station installation will re-establish native vegetation, improve nesting habitat, restore game fish populations and improve waterfowl habitat on 677 acres. • 3,778 acres of in-lake habitat structures to improve game fish habitat and food sources. • 184 acres of fish community reclamation to eliminate rough fish abundance and re-establish native aquatic vegetation. • 35 acres of vegetative restoration to improve habitat for wildlifeThis Program will utilize elements of successful local and previously funded LSOHC Programs throughout the state of Minnesota and implement them into a Watershed Habitat Restoration Program that will enhance, restore and protect fisheries, waterfowl and wildlife habitat within the SRRWD. Project scope in this Program consists of accelerated wildlife management areas, waterfowl production areas, Minnesota Prairie Recovery, living shallow lakes and wetland initiatives along with accelerated shallow lakes and wetland enhancements. In addition the scope of work will consist of rough fish management and game fish habitat improvement, enhancement and protection. Long-term goals are to restore, enhance and protect the lakes, wetlands and streams in the SRRWD. This will result in improving habitat and water quality of public waters within, as well as, outside of the Shell Rock River Watershed District – Cedar River, Upper Iowa River, Mississippi River and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico. These long term goals interconnect and re-establish important flyway habitats within Minnesota, such as: Mississippi, Le Sueur and La Qui Parle. The goal is to establish waterfowl and fish populations to create the wildlife mecca that was recorded in the late 1800’s (See attached article). Finally, this Program will preserve an outdoor legacy for Minnesotans to use and enjoy for generations.The SRRWD is in the midst of a watershed habitat transformation. The projects funded in this proposal complement and advance the habitat benefits of previously funded LSOHC projects including: Wedge Creek, White Lake and Fountain Lake Fish Barriers (2009-10); Shell Rock River Headwater’s Project (2011-12); Albert Lea Lake Dam and Fish Barrier (2013-14); and Goose Creek Fish Barrier (CPL Grant) (2013-2014). Methods and procedures utilized by the SRRWD on successful projects previously funded by the LSOHC will be implemented on 2015 funded projects. The District will leverage its experience to ensure optimum project design and implementation, resulting in rapid habitat restoration and enhancement benefits. In turn, implementation of these projects will provide long-term protection of the SRRWD’s shallow lakes, wetlands and streams. The SRRWD proposes to improve degraded habitat conditions through implementation of projects on a lake-shed basis. District staff and board members have demonstrated the ability and capacity to complete these projects with 2015 funding from the LSHOC. The projects are identified as a high priority in the SRRWD Management Plan, a plan developed with public participation, subject to public review and approval by the SRRWD Board. District staff focuses on identifying existing impairments through current conservation modeling and monitoring water quality within the SRRWD, which results in determining project locations with the greatest net return in habitat restoration. In 2004 the SRRWD released its first Watershed Management Plan to implement reasonable and necessary improvements to natural resources and water quality. Some of the major beneficial outcomes were: overall improved water quality, an aggressive Pollution Prevention Program that centered on repairing septic systems, and restoring a key headwaters lake. The District is now implementing its second ten-year Watershed Management Plan and welcomes the opportunity to build on the success of the first Watershed Management Plan and partner with the LSOHC to demonstrate the leveraged watershed based benefits that can accrue from a strategic approach to habitat restoration and protection efforts. This Program model can be replicated in similar watersheds throughout Minnesota. We have a proven track record with the LSOHC of implementing projects that protect, restore and enhance Minnesota’s natural resources. The Program is designed to shifts habitat capacity of the watershed to a recognizable level for generations to come and complements the habitat restoration and protection benefits from three previous LSOHC funding phases.",,7/1/2015,6/30/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Andy,Henschel,Shell Rock River Watershed District,214 West Main Street ,Albert Lea,MN,56007,(507) 377-5785,andy.henschel@co.freeborn.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,Freeborn,Prairie Region,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/shell-rock-river-watershed-habitat-restoration-program-phase-iv,,,,,43.670171,-93.403461

",,"Activity 1 Complete design and all permit requirements for a ""sweeping"" electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1. The MN DNR believed that the best approach to keep Invasive Carp out of the upper Mississippi River watershed was to close the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock. The lock is administered by the US Army Corps of Engineers and required an act of Congress to shut down. Minnesota senators and representatives successfully added an amendment to the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) that called for Upper St. Anthony Falls lock closure within one year of passage of the bill. The bill passed both chambers of the federal legislature and was signed into law by President Obama on June 10, 2014. Lock closure happened June 10, 2015.   Prior to lock closure, the MN DNR initiated an invasive carp deterrent project at Lock and Dam 1 based on the status of carp population at the time and the uncertain political will to close a federal lock.  The DNR contracted with Smith-Root Inc. to design an electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1.  With the passage of the 2014 WRRDA bill, construction of a Lock and Dam 1 barrier was not necessary. But, due to the timing of passage of the bill, there was no cost savings by terminating the design contract for the electrical barrier. Also, by completing the design, the MN DNR has a better understanding of the costs, potential effectiveness, and safety concerns associated with this technology. The contractor submitted a final design to the DNR in 2014. Activity 2 Complete design, acquire permits, and construct deterrent barriers in Minnesota's portion of the Missouri River watershed. Waters in the southwest corner of Minnesota were vulnerable to Invasive Carp expansion from the Missouri River watershed.

With these culverts removed, the township gravel road acts as a physical berm to separate the watersheds. • Okabena Creek Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier by removing two small culverts and installing a 12 foot by 6 foot electrified culvert. The barrier prevents upstream movement of fish. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Soil and Water Conservation District and a private landowner to build up an earthen dike berm to disconnect the watersheds. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Highway Department and the Minnesota Department of Transportation to install a grate system and tile line caps to prevent fish from moving across a watershed boundary via the tile line system. • Minnesota River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Little Sioux River - Rock River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch and an outlet structure was modified to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Illinois Lake Protective Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier on a WMA downstream of the outlet of Illinois Lake.

A joint powers agreement with Iowa DNR was executed to help share costs on a barrier to prevent Invasive Carp in the Missouri River watershed from entering Minnesota. An electric barrier at the outlet of Lower Gar Lake became fully operational in December 2012. Activity 4 Complete evaluation on feasibility of barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The Minnesota River is a free flowing system whose watershed covers much of southern Minnesota. The MN DNR contracted with the Water Resource Center at Minnesota State - Mankato on a project to evaluate several Minnesota River aspects including barrier feasibility.  Increasing the understanding of this system aided the DNR in evaluating deterrent barrier potential on the Minnesota River and its tributaries. Additionally, the project provided information on habitat suitability and described the Minnesota/Red River connection.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in July 2018. Activity 5 Implement and evaluate deterrent barriers at Lock and Dams. The susceptible portion of the St. Croix River is not conducive to electrical barriers due to the high level of recreational use (safety concerns) and the required cooperation from Wisconsin, which has expressed limited to no interest in constructing a barrier. The best alternative is exploring deterrent technologies in lock(s) below the confluence with the Mississippi River. The MN DNR contracted with the Minnesota Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center to evaluate the potential effectiveness of flow modifications and an existing acoustic deterrent in Mississippi River Lock and Dam 8 to prevent Invasive Carp movement.   A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in March 2019. Activity 6 Complete design, acquire permits and construct deterrent barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The uncertainty associated with a barrier (effectiveness, timeline, cost, native community impacts, and ability to construct) on the Minnesota River was high.  This was substantiated by the evaluation completed by Minnesota State Mankato (Activity 4).  Given this scenario, DNR Fisheries identified high value aquatic resources that could be protected at locations in tributaries.  Construction of the two electric barriers, Madison/Eagle lakes protective barrier and Elysian/Buffalo lakes protective barrier, were completed in February 2019. Activity 7 Lock and Dam 5 Acoustic Deterrent Feasibility Study Mississippi River Lock and Dam 5 was identified as a potential location for installation of an acoustic barrier to deter upstream movement of Invasive Carp.  Before any potential construction project, the DNR required a feasibility study to estimate the effectiveness, construction costs, and annual operation/maintenance costs.  The MN DNR contracted with the University of Minnesota-Duluth to complete the study.  Study results suggest further development of the technology was needed before deployment at this site.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in December 2018.   ",7/1/2012,11/4/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Nick,Frohnauer,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5670,nick.frohnauer@state.mn.us,"Grants/Contracts, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Blue Earth, Cottonwood, Hennepin, Jackson, Waseca",,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/protect-aquatic-habitat-asian-carp,,,,,43.670749,-95.282215

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8. Rush Creek (Winona); 9. Mill Creek (Olmsted & Fillmore); 10. Newburg Creek (Fillmore); 11. Willow Creek (Fillmore).; 12. Cedar Valley Creek (Winona); 13. Pickwick Creek (Winona); 14. Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.672056,-92.076873

These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream.

A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,43.705069,-92.32631

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Streams in Minnesota support a wealth of biodiversity, including 162 fish species and 48 mussel species of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1). Projects were selected from a prioritized list using criteria such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. Two of the projects on our parcel list (Whetstone River and Fish Lake Dam) would involve partners, who will contribute in-kind staff time as well as financial resources toward the projects' completion. Allocated funds will only allow completion of our highest priority project, restoration of Mounds Creek, along with three smaller fish passage projects at Fish Creek, Crane Lake, and Lake Carlos. If additional matching funds are found, available OHF money will be shifted to fund other projects on our priority list.Department resources for stream habitat work falls far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department and partners such as Trout Unlimited, as well as smaller groups such as lake associations who seek funding through the Conservation Partners Legacy program. We propose to continue funding for two stream habitat specialist positions to enable this increased effort.

These forests, which provide critical habitat for forest dependent birds, are under threat from invasive species like reed canary grass. Without active management these forests will continue to decline over time. Our program focused on controlling invasive species and regenerating a variety of tree and shrub species. We prepared sites for planting or natural regeneration using herbicide, disking, or mowing; planted tree seedlings, cottonwood cuttings, or direct seeded; protected trees from deer and voles; improved tree vigor and growth through selective thinning; and controlled weeds (herbicide, mowing) after planting. Our geographic scope included the Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border, and the lower ends of major tributaries. Much of this area included state forest, Wildlife Management Areas, or National Wildlife and Fish Refuge lands. Our priorities were determined in cooperation with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Army Corps of Engineers. All projects were on public lands owned and managed by these agencies. Priorities were based on forest condition and threats, habitat needs, logistics, and access. Our goal was to prevent or control invasive species long enough to establish forest canopy and maintain a diverse forest structure that benefits birds and other wildlife. Our objectives were designed to utilize a variety of enhancement tools, monitor results, and apply that information to designing new projects. A description of each project is provided below. For several sites additional work will be completed with Phase 2 of our floodplain forest enhancement program. At Gores WMA, a 20-acre site north of Red Wing, we completed site preparation, planted bare root seedlings on 10 acres, and completed post planting weed control following tree planting on 10 additional acres that had been previously planted by US Army Corps of Engineers. At the Cannon River Collischan Road Willow Project, a 10-acre site near Red Wing, we treated reed canary grass and cut willow trees along strips to encourage aggressive expansion of willows to prevent reed canary grass encroachment into adjacent high quality floodplain forest. At Dukes Pond, a 22-acre site near Red Wing, we completed site preparation on 15 acres along the edge of existing high quality floodplain forest. Our intention was to plant trees the next fall on the treated area, but unusually high water prevented this from occurring. Bare root seedlings and potted trees had been purchased, so instead of planting the treated areas we planted 7 adjacent acres where DNR Forestry was planning a timber harvest. The planted trees will regenerate when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At North Clear Lake, a 9-acre site north of Red Wing, bare root seedlings were planted in the understory of existing floodplain forest scheduled for harvest by DNR Forestry. The planted trees will give a head start to regeneration when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At East Indian Creek Delta, a 55-acre site north of Weaver, site preparation was completed and tree and shrub seedlings were planted in an area dominated by ash trees. Shade tolerant seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to the death and decline of older trees. At Whitewater Delta, a 51-acre site near Weaver, buckthorn was removed and bare root seedlings and potted trees were planted in an area dominated by ash trees with pockets of reed canary grass. The seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to emerald ash borer impacts on the exiting trees. At Whalen Tract, a 55-acre site just north of the Iowa border, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, and post planting weed control. At Whitewater DNR, a 16-acre site approximately 5 miles upstream of the mouth of the Whitewater River, site preparation and direct seeding were completed. At Cannon River Bottoms State Forest, a 30-acre site near Red Wing, site preparation was completed and tree seedlings and potted trees were planted in open pockets of reed canary grass within existing forest scheduled for harvest. At Root River, a 93-acre site near La Crescent, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, direct seeding, and post planting weed control. At four of the above sites (Cannon River Collischan Road Willow project, Whitewater DNR, Root River, Whalen Tract) up to 8 acres within or near each site was also treated for reed canary grass and planted with different tree species and stock types. This was part of a LCCMR study evaluating reed canary grass control, and tree survival and growth. Evaluating success will take time. Because trees are slow growing, it can take a decade or longer for them to grow large enough to form a canopy, which will ultimately determine the success of these projects. Preliminary findings indicate initial survival of seedlings was variable. At some sites, post planting observations suggest low survival, however, small seedlings are difficult to locate in the forest understory. First year survival of bare root seedlings at the LCCMR study sites was 80-90%. Survival of potted trees at many sites was good, however there was some damage from deer. Other findings resulting from this grant included: post tree planting weed control and maintenance is essential for tree seedling survival; tree guards and deer repellent are effective at protecting trees from deer and voles; cottonwood cuttings were relatively easy to install and effective at establishing trees; swamp white oak were resilient, relatively fast growing, and resistant to deer browse making them a good choice for these sites; plantings on drier sites, with proper maintenance, take less time to establish than wetter sites; good natural regeneration can occur on some sites after exposing mineral soils; and back-up sites are needed to adjust to flooding situations which may prevent scheduled tree plantings. These findings have been incorporated into project management prescriptions. ",7/1/2014,6/30/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Tim,Schlagenhaft,The National Audubon Society,2000 W.

Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.813654,-92.20263

This includes over 7 miles of stream frontage. Three new Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) were created around the fee acquisitions, opening up 1,505 acres of habitat to public recreation. Restoration or enhancement work was completed on 225 acres of bluff prairies and forests, much of it on lands protected through this program. ",,"In it's proposal, this project identified three primary components: 1) fee title acquisition of priority parcels, 2) restoration and enhancement of prairie and forest habitat in important complexes of protected habitat, and 3) the strategic protection of high-quality habitat on private lands through the acquisition of conservation easements. Work done using this appropriation accomplished all three of those objectives. The Nature Conservancy used funds from this appropriation in acquiring 1,505 acres of land in fee from three landowners. These acquisition have all been transferred to the MN DNR Division of Fish and Wildlife, creating three new management units know as 7 Springs, Rush Creek Woods, and Choice Wildlife Management Area (WMA). This new public land protects over 7 miles of trout stream frontage, along with important forest and bluff prairie habitat. TNC worked closely with DNR Wildlife in prioritizing and acquiring all three of these units, and performing important restoration and enhancement work after acquisition. The size and cost of these acquisitions and the time frames provided by the sellers, it was necessary for the Conservancy to use $2,106,000 of private funds to complete the largest acquisition.  Restoration and enhancement through this appropriation focused primarily on projects on acquired tracts, where TNC restored 44 acres of forest and enhanced 100 acres of forest and 81 acres of prairie. TNC worked with DNR staff, Conservation Corps MN, and local contractors to remove encroaching brush from large bluff prairies and oak savanna on Choice and Rush Creek Woods WMAs. We also treated invasive species in fire-dependent oak woods surrounding prairie areas, allowing prescribed fire in the future to manage larger areas and maintain the diverse transition zone that includes prairie, savanna and oak forest. One burn has already occurred at Rush Creek Woods, and another is planned for Choice WMA this spring to follow up on these enhancement projects. Several floodplain crop fields included on Choice WMA were restored to mesic hardwood forests. These fields were planted through direct seeding in order to provide the best chance of having sufficient seedlings survive the expected impacts of deer browsing.  The Minnesota Land Trust (MLT) used funds from this appropriation to acquire conservation easements from three landowners, totaling 630 acres. These protected acres include dry bluff prairie, oak savanna and woodlands, and mesic hardwood forests. A mile and a half of undeveloped shoreline was also protected along designated trout streams and tributaries. One easement in particular, East Indian Creek, was the key final piece to solidifying a protected corridor running from McCarthy WMA all the way through to Whitewater WMA, linking together over 28,000 acres of protected land.  MLT strategically concentrated its land protection activities on high priority upland habitats, including bluff prairies, forests, savanna and high quality trout streams. MLT targeted private lands that helped fill gaps in the existing protected land framework, contained the highest-quality habitat, and provided the greatest leverage to the state. The Land Trust sought donated easement value in these areas whenever possible but purchased easements that help complete key complexes as necessary. This was the first grant in Southeast Minnesota where MLT transitioned to a competitive, market-based approach to identifying and securing conservation easements. This approach proved to be effective, leveraging $138,800, or 14% of MLT's total appropriation. Working closely with partners was key to the success of this program. Both TNC and MLT worked with other local stakeholders including Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs), DNR staff from multiple agencies, local contractors, and landowners in identifying opportunities, prioritizing projects, and completing them effectively. The collaboration built through this effort continues to benefit ongoing work funded through LSOHC and helps inform other conservation initiatives, such as local water planning and habitat monitoring carried out by other entities. TNC and MLT are committed to staying engaged in Southeast Minnesota and continuing the successful work of this partnership.

",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,43.837504,-92.191588

Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8. Rush Creek (Winona); 9. Mill Creek (Olmsted & Fillmore); 10. Newburg Creek (Fillmore); 11. Willow Creek (Fillmore).; 12. Cedar Valley Creek (Winona); 13. Pickwick Creek (Winona); 14. Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.840012,-92.050527

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,43.841387,-92.193181

Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.857351,-91.829157

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.872679,-92.218

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Minnesota may be the Land of 10,000 lakes, but often overlooked are its over 69,000 miles of streams. From small trout streams to the mighty Mississippi, streams support a wealth of biodiversity and also provide excellent fishing opportunities. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as Southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers can pursue.Minnesota streams host 162 fish species and 48 mussel species, of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. Streams in Minnesota have been degraded through a history of alterations to the streams themselves by channelization (straightening), poor riparian management, and fragmentation by barriers such as dams. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) works to restore or enhance habitat to address these impacts, benefiting fish, mussels, and other aquatic life. However, department resources for stream habitat work fall far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department. In past rounds of OHF, stream habitat has been part of a larger MNDNR package of aquatic habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement projects. In this round we have chosen to create a proposal focused solely on stream restoration and enhancement, with aquatic habitat protection in a separate proposal.One of the biggest limitations to fish and mussel species is the fragmentation of rivers. Dams and other obstructions block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas. The juvenile life stage of mussels spends it's first weeks of life on the gills of a fish, and relies on that fish to transport it upstream to hospitable habitats. Barriers can lead to the loss of fish and mussel species above dams, and reduce populations living below them. Often dams and other barriers are not longer serving their intended function and can be removed. In cases where the dam is still functioning, the structure can be modified to allow fish passage. Examples of modifications include projects that have converted dams into rapids, and construction of nature-like fishways around or over dams.A case study in the benefits of fish passage is the removal of a dam on the Pomme de Terre River in Appleton, MN. Following removal, 10 fish species including walleye and channel catfish have returned to 42 upstream miles of river that became accessible. Mussel species have also benefited, with two native mussel species now found in areas upstream of the dam where formerly they had been absent. Another example is the modification of the Heidberg Dam on the Wild Rice River to allow fish passage, where 10 fish species including walleye, sauger, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass are now found where they had formerly been absent, as far as 75 miles upstream of the dam. These case studies show that although the footprint of fish passage projects is small (typically only a few acres) and the cost per acre appears high, the benefits go far beyond the project site. We can impact miles of stream in a single project, and the benefits will endure.Some proposed fish passage projects target species living in lakes that use streams for spawning. Many species including northern pike, walleye, suckers, and numerous minnow species migrate out of lakes and into streams to spawn before returning to the lake. On many lakes, the outlet has been dammed in order to stabilize water levels for property owners. These dams block fish from returning to the lake when they've finished spawning, as well as blocking their offspring from migrating to the lake when they mature.The potential for fish passage projects to enable access by invasive species has been examined for all proposed projects. None of these projects serve as a barrier between problem species such as Invasive Carp and upstream waters. Most aquatic invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels or Eurasian water milfoil) rely on other vectors such as unintentional transport by recreational boaters, rather than swimming upstream past barriers.Many streams in Minnesota have also been degraded by habitat alteration such as channelization (straightening). This simplifies the habitat and eliminates the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by different life stages of fish. Other streams have issues with bank erosion that degrade habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our package of fish passage and stream channel restoration and enhancement includes 7 projects that occur in 4 of 5 LSOHC planning regions. Although the footprint of projects is 22 acres, the projects will benefit over 4,400 acres of lakes and streams (refer to Table 1) through restoration or enhancement of fish passage. Projects were selected from a prioritized list that includes factors such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. We have chosen to include parcels in this proposal above and beyond what can be accomplished with allocated funds. This will allow flexibility to complete additional projects should new sources of matching funds become available.Several of the projects on our parcel list (e.g. the Adrian Dam, and Cottonwood River dams) will involve partnership with other state agencies or local governments. Partners in many cases are local governments that own a dam proposed for removal or modification. In all cases local partners are supportive of the project, and will contribute in-kind staff time toward the projects' completion. This request also funds an ongoing stream habitat coordinator position and a part-time intern for two years. The increased work of coordinating complex stream projects funded by OHF is greater than can be handled by existing MNDNR staff. These positions create the capacity for MNDNR to effectively complete the proposed projects.",,,,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Brian,Nerbonne,MN DNR,500 Lafayette Rd.

One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,43.884651,-92.228128

In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1).

",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,43.947975,-95.2144

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,43.967788,-91.500663

This effort builds on previous LSOHC funding to control reed canary grass and plant trees as part of a long-term effort.,"The Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border contains some of the largest and most significant tracts of floodplain forest along the entire Upper Mississippi River. These forests and mixed wetlands cover tens of thousands of acres and are especially critical to many species of birds and other wildlife, including wood ducks which use these areas for nesting and feeding.These forests are under threat. While historically diverse in the number, age, and size of tree species, much of the forest now consists of silver maple ranging from 50-70 years old. These trees are expected to live another 50-70 years, after which they will die-off and disappear. Unfortunately, when trees are removed through harvest or die naturally, reed canary grass and other invasive species move in and prevent natural regeneration. This is occurring at a number of locations within the project area, and without aggressive, long-term management these floodplain forests will be greatly reduced or in some locations disappear completely. Floodplain forest regeneration is a slow process taking decades to accomplish. By selectively controlling invasive species following harvest, blowdown, or other events and planting trees the forest can be maintained long-term. Restoring forest at small sites within larger tracts will ensure that a diversity of tree species, sizes, and ages are present. This approach over time will maintain large contiguous blocks of forest and continue to provide habitat for many wildlife species, including rare species like ceruleuan warbler and red-shouldered hawk.This proposal seeks funding to continue implementing floodplain forest restoration and enhancement projects throughout the project area which includes the Mississippi River and lower ends of major tributaries. The number of sites needing enhancement or restoration is extensive and will take many years of consistent work to restore. Sites identified in this proposal range from 20-115 acres in size. All sites are located on public lands within Minnesota state forests, WMA's, Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, or Corps of Engineers owned lands. Each site is threatened by invasive species and natural regeneration of floodplain forest trees is not expected without aggressive management. Funding will be used to control invasive species, especially reed canary grass, using a combination of prescribed burns, mowing or forestry mulching, and herbicide applications. Past efforts to plant seedlings into existing reed canary grass fields have not been successful, so once invasive species are controlled larger-size trees suitable to each site will be planted, or direct seeding or bare root trees may be used to create high densities of seedlings. At some sites, timber stand improvement including removing invasive species like buckthorn will be used to create small openings for diversifying forest species and age structure. Deer protection will be provided for planted trees when needed. Vole guards will be installed on the larger planted trees. This combination will allow the trees to establish and over time develop a canopy that limits or prevents invasive species and maintains the overall diversity of the forest.Priority sites were determined in conjunction with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Corps of Engineers foresters and wildlife managers and are locations under serious threat of losing the floodplain forest. All of the sites are on public lands open to hunting and fishing. Three of the sites are listed with limited hunting access. These are within areas closed to waterfowl hunting on the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge. They are open to all legal hunting during other times of the year. Audubon Minnesota will serve as the project manager and coordinate the work and associated contracts. Much of the tree planting work will be done through Conservation Corps Minnesota.

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,44.014476,-91.790771

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs.

",,"Activity 1 Complete design and all permit requirements for a ""sweeping"" electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1. The MN DNR believed that the best approach to keep Invasive Carp out of the upper Mississippi River watershed was to close the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock. The lock is administered by the US Army Corps of Engineers and required an act of Congress to shut down. Minnesota senators and representatives successfully added an amendment to the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) that called for Upper St. Anthony Falls lock closure within one year of passage of the bill. The bill passed both chambers of the federal legislature and was signed into law by President Obama on June 10, 2014. Lock closure happened June 10, 2015.   Prior to lock closure, the MN DNR initiated an invasive carp deterrent project at Lock and Dam 1 based on the status of carp population at the time and the uncertain political will to close a federal lock.  The DNR contracted with Smith-Root Inc. to design an electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1.  With the passage of the 2014 WRRDA bill, construction of a Lock and Dam 1 barrier was not necessary. But, due to the timing of passage of the bill, there was no cost savings by terminating the design contract for the electrical barrier. Also, by completing the design, the MN DNR has a better understanding of the costs, potential effectiveness, and safety concerns associated with this technology. The contractor submitted a final design to the DNR in 2014. Activity 2 Complete design, acquire permits, and construct deterrent barriers in Minnesota's portion of the Missouri River watershed. Waters in the southwest corner of Minnesota were vulnerable to Invasive Carp expansion from the Missouri River watershed. MN DNR fisheries identified locations to prevent Invasive carp from entering Minnesota waters and from entering the Mississippi River and Minnesota River tributaries through watershed breaches. • Okabena Creek - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR acquired a flowage easement and removed two road culverts. With these culverts removed, the township gravel road acts as a physical berm to separate the watersheds. • Okabena Creek Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier by removing two small culverts and installing a 12 foot by 6 foot electrified culvert. The barrier prevents upstream movement of fish. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Soil and Water Conservation District and a private landowner to build up an earthen dike berm to disconnect the watersheds. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Highway Department and the Minnesota Department of Transportation to install a grate system and tile line caps to prevent fish from moving across a watershed boundary via the tile line system. • Minnesota River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Little Sioux River - Rock River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch and an outlet structure was modified to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Illinois Lake Protective Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier on a WMA downstream of the outlet of Illinois Lake. Activity 3 Develop cost share agreement with State of Iowa to construct barrier at Lower Gar Outlet. A joint powers agreement with Iowa DNR was executed to help share costs on a barrier to prevent Invasive Carp in the Missouri River watershed from entering Minnesota. An electric barrier at the outlet of Lower Gar Lake became fully operational in December 2012. Activity 4 Complete evaluation on feasibility of barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The Minnesota River is a free flowing system whose watershed covers much of southern Minnesota. The MN DNR contracted with the Water Resource Center at Minnesota State - Mankato on a project to evaluate several Minnesota River aspects including barrier feasibility.  Increasing the understanding of this system aided the DNR in evaluating deterrent barrier potential on the Minnesota River and its tributaries. Additionally, the project provided information on habitat suitability and described the Minnesota/Red River connection.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in July 2018. Activity 5 Implement and evaluate deterrent barriers at Lock and Dams. The susceptible portion of the St. Croix River is not conducive to electrical barriers due to the high level of recreational use (safety concerns) and the required cooperation from Wisconsin, which has expressed limited to no interest in constructing a barrier. The best alternative is exploring deterrent technologies in lock(s) below the confluence with the Mississippi River. The MN DNR contracted with the Minnesota Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center to evaluate the potential effectiveness of flow modifications and an existing acoustic deterrent in Mississippi River Lock and Dam 8 to prevent Invasive Carp movement.   A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in March 2019. Activity 6 Complete design, acquire permits and construct deterrent barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The uncertainty associated with a barrier (effectiveness, timeline, cost, native community impacts, and ability to construct) on the Minnesota River was high.  This was substantiated by the evaluation completed by Minnesota State Mankato (Activity 4).  Given this scenario, DNR Fisheries identified high value aquatic resources that could be protected at locations in tributaries.  Construction of the two electric barriers, Madison/Eagle lakes protective barrier and Elysian/Buffalo lakes protective barrier, were completed in February 2019. Activity 7 Lock and Dam 5 Acoustic Deterrent Feasibility Study Mississippi River Lock and Dam 5 was identified as a potential location for installation of an acoustic barrier to deter upstream movement of Invasive Carp.  Before any potential construction project, the DNR required a feasibility study to estimate the effectiveness, construction costs, and annual operation/maintenance costs.  The MN DNR contracted with the University of Minnesota-Duluth to complete the study.  Study results suggest further development of the technology was needed before deployment at this site.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in December 2018.   ",7/1/2012,11/4/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Nick,Frohnauer,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5670,nick.frohnauer@state.mn.us,"Grants/Contracts, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Blue Earth, Cottonwood, Hennepin, Jackson, Waseca",,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/protect-aquatic-habitat-asian-carp,,,,,44.065784,-93.749717

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Streams in Minnesota support a wealth of biodiversity, including 162 fish species and 48 mussel species of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1). Projects were selected from a prioritized list using criteria such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. Two of the projects on our parcel list (Whetstone River and Fish Lake Dam) would involve partners, who will contribute in-kind staff time as well as financial resources toward the projects' completion. Allocated funds will only allow completion of our highest priority project, restoration of Mounds Creek, along with three smaller fish passage projects at Fish Creek, Crane Lake, and Lake Carlos. If additional matching funds are found, available OHF money will be shifted to fund other projects on our priority list.Department resources for stream habitat work falls far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department and partners such as Trout Unlimited, as well as smaller groups such as lake associations who seek funding through the Conservation Partners Legacy program. We propose to continue funding for two stream habitat specialist positions to enable this increased effort.

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Streams in Minnesota support a wealth of biodiversity, including 162 fish species and 48 mussel species of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1). Projects were selected from a prioritized list using criteria such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. Two of the projects on our parcel list (Whetstone River and Fish Lake Dam) would involve partners, who will contribute in-kind staff time as well as financial resources toward the projects' completion. Allocated funds will only allow completion of our highest priority project, restoration of Mounds Creek, along with three smaller fish passage projects at Fish Creek, Crane Lake, and Lake Carlos. If additional matching funds are found, available OHF money will be shifted to fund other projects on our priority list.Department resources for stream habitat work falls far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department and partners such as Trout Unlimited, as well as smaller groups such as lake associations who seek funding through the Conservation Partners Legacy program. We propose to continue funding for two stream habitat specialist positions to enable this increased effort.

These forests, which provide critical habitat for forest dependent birds, are under threat from invasive species like reed canary grass. Without active management these forests will continue to decline over time. Our program focused on controlling invasive species and regenerating a variety of tree and shrub species. We prepared sites for planting or natural regeneration using herbicide, disking, or mowing; planted tree seedlings, cottonwood cuttings, or direct seeded; protected trees from deer and voles; improved tree vigor and growth through selective thinning; and controlled weeds (herbicide, mowing) after planting. Our geographic scope included the Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border, and the lower ends of major tributaries. Much of this area included state forest, Wildlife Management Areas, or National Wildlife and Fish Refuge lands. Our priorities were determined in cooperation with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Army Corps of Engineers. All projects were on public lands owned and managed by these agencies. Priorities were based on forest condition and threats, habitat needs, logistics, and access. Our goal was to prevent or control invasive species long enough to establish forest canopy and maintain a diverse forest structure that benefits birds and other wildlife. Our objectives were designed to utilize a variety of enhancement tools, monitor results, and apply that information to designing new projects. A description of each project is provided below. For several sites additional work will be completed with Phase 2 of our floodplain forest enhancement program. At Gores WMA, a 20-acre site north of Red Wing, we completed site preparation, planted bare root seedlings on 10 acres, and completed post planting weed control following tree planting on 10 additional acres that had been previously planted by US Army Corps of Engineers. At the Cannon River Collischan Road Willow Project, a 10-acre site near Red Wing, we treated reed canary grass and cut willow trees along strips to encourage aggressive expansion of willows to prevent reed canary grass encroachment into adjacent high quality floodplain forest. At Dukes Pond, a 22-acre site near Red Wing, we completed site preparation on 15 acres along the edge of existing high quality floodplain forest. Our intention was to plant trees the next fall on the treated area, but unusually high water prevented this from occurring. Bare root seedlings and potted trees had been purchased, so instead of planting the treated areas we planted 7 adjacent acres where DNR Forestry was planning a timber harvest. The planted trees will regenerate when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At North Clear Lake, a 9-acre site north of Red Wing, bare root seedlings were planted in the understory of existing floodplain forest scheduled for harvest by DNR Forestry. The planted trees will give a head start to regeneration when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At East Indian Creek Delta, a 55-acre site north of Weaver, site preparation was completed and tree and shrub seedlings were planted in an area dominated by ash trees. Shade tolerant seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to the death and decline of older trees. At Whitewater Delta, a 51-acre site near Weaver, buckthorn was removed and bare root seedlings and potted trees were planted in an area dominated by ash trees with pockets of reed canary grass. The seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to emerald ash borer impacts on the exiting trees. At Whalen Tract, a 55-acre site just north of the Iowa border, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, and post planting weed control. At Whitewater DNR, a 16-acre site approximately 5 miles upstream of the mouth of the Whitewater River, site preparation and direct seeding were completed. At Cannon River Bottoms State Forest, a 30-acre site near Red Wing, site preparation was completed and tree seedlings and potted trees were planted in open pockets of reed canary grass within existing forest scheduled for harvest. At Root River, a 93-acre site near La Crescent, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, direct seeding, and post planting weed control. At four of the above sites (Cannon River Collischan Road Willow project, Whitewater DNR, Root River, Whalen Tract) up to 8 acres within or near each site was also treated for reed canary grass and planted with different tree species and stock types. This was part of a LCCMR study evaluating reed canary grass control, and tree survival and growth. Evaluating success will take time. Because trees are slow growing, it can take a decade or longer for them to grow large enough to form a canopy, which will ultimately determine the success of these projects. Preliminary findings indicate initial survival of seedlings was variable. At some sites, post planting observations suggest low survival, however, small seedlings are difficult to locate in the forest understory. First year survival of bare root seedlings at the LCCMR study sites was 80-90%. Survival of potted trees at many sites was good, however there was some damage from deer. Other findings resulting from this grant included: post tree planting weed control and maintenance is essential for tree seedling survival; tree guards and deer repellent are effective at protecting trees from deer and voles; cottonwood cuttings were relatively easy to install and effective at establishing trees; swamp white oak were resilient, relatively fast growing, and resistant to deer browse making them a good choice for these sites; plantings on drier sites, with proper maintenance, take less time to establish than wetter sites; good natural regeneration can occur on some sites after exposing mineral soils; and back-up sites are needed to adjust to flooding situations which may prevent scheduled tree plantings. These findings have been incorporated into project management prescriptions. ",7/1/2014,6/30/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Tim,Schlagenhaft,The National Audubon Society,2000 W.

Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers can pursue.Minnesota streams host 162 fish species and 48 mussel species, of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. Streams in Minnesota have been degraded through a history of alterations to the streams themselves by channelization (straightening), poor riparian management, and fragmentation by barriers such as dams. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) works to restore or enhance habitat to address these impacts, benefiting fish, mussels, and other aquatic life. However, department resources for stream habitat work fall far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department. In past rounds of OHF, stream habitat has been part of a larger MNDNR package of aquatic habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement projects. In this round we have chosen to create a proposal focused solely on stream restoration and enhancement, with aquatic habitat protection in a separate proposal.One of the biggest limitations to fish and mussel species is the fragmentation of rivers. Dams and other obstructions block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas. The juvenile life stage of mussels spends it's first weeks of life on the gills of a fish, and relies on that fish to transport it upstream to hospitable habitats. Barriers can lead to the loss of fish and mussel species above dams, and reduce populations living below them. Often dams and other barriers are not longer serving their intended function and can be removed. In cases where the dam is still functioning, the structure can be modified to allow fish passage. Examples of modifications include projects that have converted dams into rapids, and construction of nature-like fishways around or over dams.A case study in the benefits of fish passage is the removal of a dam on the Pomme de Terre River in Appleton, MN. Following removal, 10 fish species including walleye and channel catfish have returned to 42 upstream miles of river that became accessible. Mussel species have also benefited, with two native mussel species now found in areas upstream of the dam where formerly they had been absent. Another example is the modification of the Heidberg Dam on the Wild Rice River to allow fish passage, where 10 fish species including walleye, sauger, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass are now found where they had formerly been absent, as far as 75 miles upstream of the dam. These case studies show that although the footprint of fish passage projects is small (typically only a few acres) and the cost per acre appears high, the benefits go far beyond the project site. We can impact miles of stream in a single project, and the benefits will endure.Some proposed fish passage projects target species living in lakes that use streams for spawning. Many species including northern pike, walleye, suckers, and numerous minnow species migrate out of lakes and into streams to spawn before returning to the lake. On many lakes, the outlet has been dammed in order to stabilize water levels for property owners. These dams block fish from returning to the lake when they've finished spawning, as well as blocking their offspring from migrating to the lake when they mature.The potential for fish passage projects to enable access by invasive species has been examined for all proposed projects. None of these projects serve as a barrier between problem species such as Invasive Carp and upstream waters. Most aquatic invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels or Eurasian water milfoil) rely on other vectors such as unintentional transport by recreational boaters, rather than swimming upstream past barriers.Many streams in Minnesota have also been degraded by habitat alteration such as channelization (straightening). This simplifies the habitat and eliminates the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by different life stages of fish. Other streams have issues with bank erosion that degrade habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our package of fish passage and stream channel restoration and enhancement includes 7 projects that occur in 4 of 5 LSOHC planning regions.

Projects were selected from a prioritized list that includes factors such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. We have chosen to include parcels in this proposal above and beyond what can be accomplished with allocated funds. This will allow flexibility to complete additional projects should new sources of matching funds become available.Several of the projects on our parcel list (e.g. the Adrian Dam, and Cottonwood River dams) will involve partnership with other state agencies or local governments. Partners in many cases are local governments that own a dam proposed for removal or modification. In all cases local partners are supportive of the project, and will contribute in-kind staff time toward the projects' completion. This request also funds an ongoing stream habitat coordinator position and a part-time intern for two years. The increased work of coordinating complex stream projects funded by OHF is greater than can be handled by existing MNDNR staff.

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Streams in Minnesota support a wealth of biodiversity, including 162 fish species and 48 mussel species of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1). Projects were selected from a prioritized list using criteria such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. Two of the projects on our parcel list (Whetstone River and Fish Lake Dam) would involve partners, who will contribute in-kind staff time as well as financial resources toward the projects' completion. Allocated funds will only allow completion of our highest priority project, restoration of Mounds Creek, along with three smaller fish passage projects at Fish Creek, Crane Lake, and Lake Carlos. If additional matching funds are found, available OHF money will be shifted to fund other projects on our priority list.Department resources for stream habitat work falls far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department and partners such as Trout Unlimited, as well as smaller groups such as lake associations who seek funding through the Conservation Partners Legacy program. We propose to continue funding for two stream habitat specialist positions to enable this increased effort.

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,44.216406,-95.163949

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,44.219859,-92.02296

At Gores WMA, a 20-acre site north of Red Wing, we completed site preparation, planted bare root seedlings on 10 acres, and completed post planting weed control following tree planting on 10 additional acres that had been previously planted by US Army Corps of Engineers. At the Cannon River Collischan Road Willow Project, a 10-acre site near Red Wing, we treated reed canary grass and cut willow trees along strips to encourage aggressive expansion of willows to prevent reed canary grass encroachment into adjacent high quality floodplain forest. At Dukes Pond, a 22-acre site near Red Wing, we completed site preparation on 15 acres along the edge of existing high quality floodplain forest. Our intention was to plant trees the next fall on the treated area, but unusually high water prevented this from occurring. Bare root seedlings and potted trees had been purchased, so instead of planting the treated areas we planted 7 adjacent acres where DNR Forestry was planning a timber harvest. The planted trees will regenerate when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At North Clear Lake, a 9-acre site north of Red Wing, bare root seedlings were planted in the understory of existing floodplain forest scheduled for harvest by DNR Forestry. The planted trees will give a head start to regeneration when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At East Indian Creek Delta, a 55-acre site north of Weaver, site preparation was completed and tree and shrub seedlings were planted in an area dominated by ash trees. Shade tolerant seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to the death and decline of older trees. At Whitewater Delta, a 51-acre site near Weaver, buckthorn was removed and bare root seedlings and potted trees were planted in an area dominated by ash trees with pockets of reed canary grass. The seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to emerald ash borer impacts on the exiting trees. At Whalen Tract, a 55-acre site just north of the Iowa border, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, and post planting weed control. At Whitewater DNR, a 16-acre site approximately 5 miles upstream of the mouth of the Whitewater River, site preparation and direct seeding were completed. At Cannon River Bottoms State Forest, a 30-acre site near Red Wing, site preparation was completed and tree seedlings and potted trees were planted in open pockets of reed canary grass within existing forest scheduled for harvest. At Root River, a 93-acre site near La Crescent, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, direct seeding, and post planting weed control. At four of the above sites (Cannon River Collischan Road Willow project, Whitewater DNR, Root River, Whalen Tract) up to 8 acres within or near each site was also treated for reed canary grass and planted with different tree species and stock types. This was part of a LCCMR study evaluating reed canary grass control, and tree survival and growth. Evaluating success will take time. Because trees are slow growing, it can take a decade or longer for them to grow large enough to form a canopy, which will ultimately determine the success of these projects. Preliminary findings indicate initial survival of seedlings was variable. At some sites, post planting observations suggest low survival, however, small seedlings are difficult to locate in the forest understory. First year survival of bare root seedlings at the LCCMR study sites was 80-90%. Survival of potted trees at many sites was good, however there was some damage from deer. Other findings resulting from this grant included: post tree planting weed control and maintenance is essential for tree seedling survival; tree guards and deer repellent are effective at protecting trees from deer and voles; cottonwood cuttings were relatively easy to install and effective at establishing trees; swamp white oak were resilient, relatively fast growing, and resistant to deer browse making them a good choice for these sites; plantings on drier sites, with proper maintenance, take less time to establish than wetter sites; good natural regeneration can occur on some sites after exposing mineral soils; and back-up sites are needed to adjust to flooding situations which may prevent scheduled tree plantings. These findings have been incorporated into project management prescriptions. ",7/1/2014,6/30/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Tim,Schlagenhaft,The National Audubon Society,2000 W.

",,"This program incorporates the basic concepts of sustainability and ecosystem management. Minnesota has lost 99% of the original prairie and has seen dramatic declines in grassland dependent wildlife. Examples of the species showing the greatest conservation need in the Program area; the American Badger, Grasshopper Sparrow, and Bobolink to name just a few. Traditional game species are also affected by the decline in habitat such as pheasants, deer, wild turkey, and a variety of dabbling ducks which are associated to prairie wetland complexes.Publicly owned natural resource infrastructures (WMA, AMA, SNA, parks/trails, waterways) invigorates local and regional economies by providing outdoor recreation and tourism opportunities supported by hunting, fishing, wildlife observation areas, and other forms of outdoor recreation. New business concepts are likely to arise as a direct result of the recreational and tourism opportunities that will be advanced by this Green Corridor Legacy Program. Because of this concept there is wide support from many stakeholders who will assist the Program activities to achieve the desired outcomes.The Glacial River Warren created the Minnesota River Valley as it drained Lake Agassiz 10,000+ years ago. The bluff to bluff wall of water carved out one of Minnesota’s most scenic landscapes, creating unique geological features, and unique plant communities along the valley and its primary tributaries.Efforts to restore, protect, and enhance our wetlands, prairies, forests, and habitat for fish, game, and wildlife are timely as escalating development pressures threaten remaining natural lands and water resources on both public and private lands. The Green Corridor Legacy Program approach will be based on sound science concepts of plan development, setting conservation priorities, developing short and long term strategies to achieve conservation priorities, implement the strategies, and then continue monitoring the outcomes. All of these concepts and practices will follow existing state wildlife and conservation plans and natural resource management practices in conjunction with agency partners.The primary work area of the Green Corridor Legacy Program will be Redwood, Renville, Yellow Medicine, Chippewa, Brown, Nicollet, Murray, Lyon, and Cottonwood Counties with an emphasis along the Minnesota River, its tributaries, associated watersheds, and creating/expanding corridor or complexes of habitat. Connecting existing fragments of habitat along and near the Minnesota River and tributaries in the Program area will generate an ecological synergism that will allow game, wildlife, and aquatic species to flourish, while creating multiple recreational opportunities and improving public access through a series (phases) of funded activities within the nine (9) county Program area.This Program is directly consistent with the uses of the Outdoor Heritage Fund, as specified in Article XI of the Minnesota Constitution and Minnesota Statute 97A.056: to restore, protect, and enhance wetlands, prairies, forests, and habitat for fish, game, and wildlife. Furthermore, it will produce multiple conservation benefits across a large targeted and planned geographic area.Final Report: This program acquired 3 properties at total of 315 acres in our planned Lamberton area corridor that meets the above mentioned concepts and activities that produced multiple conservation benefits. 1) The Dutch Charleys Creek WMA project acquired 79 acres of which 39 acres where donated by the landowner at a value of $51,960. The property borders the eastern side of Dutch Charleys Creek and is a well documented wintering area for wildlife like deer, turkey, and pheasants. This property also connects to a FY10 OHF Green Corridor project of 83 acres. 2) Gora Praire WMA is 154 acre site that protected an expiring CRP contract and also protected small remnants of native prairie. 3) The Lamberton WMA #23 project of 80 acres of which 12 acres where donated by the landowner at a value of $16,000. This tract also protected an expiring CRP contract. This project also connects to a 90 acre FY11 OHF project by Green Corridor.This program year marked a time when land values were escalating and when many CRP contracts in the area were expiring. One high valued site of nearly 200 acres was pursued as part of this appropriation and after a tremendous amount of time/effort to work out details with the property owner no deal was reached. Overall, the Green Corridor Program received amazing support from our willing landowners as noted by their land donations, We also received strong support/encouragement from the DNR area wildlife manager and the regional DNR office in the planning/evaluation of potential sites and we also had the support of local units of government and several local wildlife conservation groups.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brad,Cobb,Redwood Area Communities Foundation (RACF),200 S.

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,44.263454,-94.032085

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,44.265172,-92.504485

These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,44.293374,-92.429182

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,44.300554,-92.435995

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8. Rush Creek (Winona); 9. Mill Creek (Olmsted & Fillmore); 10. Newburg Creek (Fillmore); 11. Willow Creek (Fillmore).; 12. Cedar Valley Creek (Winona); 13. Pickwick Creek (Winona); 14. Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,44.506325,-92.564532

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,44.562319,-92.826233

Local partners are working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to mitigate habitat degradation caused by turbidity and excess sediment accumulating at the head of the lake. Project construction is anticipated to begin in 2020.","The Upper Mississippi River is impaired for turbidity (fine sediments) from the confluence with the Minnesota River to Lake Pepin. Continued deposition of these Minnesota sourced suspended solids has resulted in a lack of aquatic vegetation, poor invertebrate production, and reduced abundance of fish and wildlife. Deep protected aquatic areas that would serve as habitat for bluegill and other species, including walleye and sauger, is lacking in both the backwaters and within large open water areas of upper Lake Pepin.Working through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Beneficial Use of Dredge Material Program, the Corps will create/enhance islands and isolated wetlands, protect banks, and create deeper water in protected areas. The expected outcomes of these features include an increase in the habitat sustainability index for ducks by at least 0.25, an increase in the average annual habitat units by a net gain of 250, restored floodplain and wetland plant communities, enhanced public access, decreased suspended solid concentrations, and more natural sediment transport and deposition. Priorities for the upper end of Lake Pepin have been established as part of a collaborative effort among state and federal agencies in the 5-state region of the Upper Mississippi River. More localized habitat objectives correspond to the Pierce County Islands Wildlife Management Plan, approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Though the state line at the upper end of Lake Pepin is adjacent the Minnesota shoreline, and thus the initial project is located in Wisconsin, the benefits of productive fish and wildlife habitats accrue equally to citizens of both Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Minnesota DNR will remain highly involved in the planning and monitoring phases. We recognize that the threshold in which habitat restoration at the head of Lake Pepin becomes cost-prohibitive is fast approaching. The current fishery is still robust, but there are concerns productivity is decreasing as sediment and turbidity impacts have long-term effects. This project is expected to restore productivity to historic levels for the next 50 years.We realize the long-term sustainability of this project is dependent on continuing upstream sediment source reductions, however, not beginning the restoration of Lake Pepin will seriously impair Minnesotans’ ability to enjoy fishing, hunting, and boating in this singularly unique reach of the Mississippi River. Lake Pepin Legacy Alliance is coordinating and administering the 35% non-federal cost-share funds for project partners, while the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources remains the official non-federal sponsor.

These forests, which provide critical habitat for forest dependent birds, are under threat from invasive species like reed canary grass. Without active management these forests will continue to decline over time. Our program focused on controlling invasive species and regenerating a variety of tree and shrub species. We prepared sites for planting or natural regeneration using herbicide, disking, or mowing; planted tree seedlings, cottonwood cuttings, or direct seeded; protected trees from deer and voles; improved tree vigor and growth through selective thinning; and controlled weeds (herbicide, mowing) after planting. Our geographic scope included the Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border, and the lower ends of major tributaries. Much of this area included state forest, Wildlife Management Areas, or National Wildlife and Fish Refuge lands. Our priorities were determined in cooperation with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Army Corps of Engineers. All projects were on public lands owned and managed by these agencies. Priorities were based on forest condition and threats, habitat needs, logistics, and access. Our goal was to prevent or control invasive species long enough to establish forest canopy and maintain a diverse forest structure that benefits birds and other wildlife. Our objectives were designed to utilize a variety of enhancement tools, monitor results, and apply that information to designing new projects. A description of each project is provided below. For several sites additional work will be completed with Phase 2 of our floodplain forest enhancement program. At Gores WMA, a 20-acre site north of Red Wing, we completed site preparation, planted bare root seedlings on 10 acres, and completed post planting weed control following tree planting on 10 additional acres that had been previously planted by US Army Corps of Engineers. At the Cannon River Collischan Road Willow Project, a 10-acre site near Red Wing, we treated reed canary grass and cut willow trees along strips to encourage aggressive expansion of willows to prevent reed canary grass encroachment into adjacent high quality floodplain forest. At Dukes Pond, a 22-acre site near Red Wing, we completed site preparation on 15 acres along the edge of existing high quality floodplain forest. Our intention was to plant trees the next fall on the treated area, but unusually high water prevented this from occurring. Bare root seedlings and potted trees had been purchased, so instead of planting the treated areas we planted 7 adjacent acres where DNR Forestry was planning a timber harvest. The planted trees will regenerate when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At North Clear Lake, a 9-acre site north of Red Wing, bare root seedlings were planted in the understory of existing floodplain forest scheduled for harvest by DNR Forestry. The planted trees will give a head start to regeneration when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At East Indian Creek Delta, a 55-acre site north of Weaver, site preparation was completed and tree and shrub seedlings were planted in an area dominated by ash trees. Shade tolerant seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to the death and decline of older trees. At Whitewater Delta, a 51-acre site near Weaver, buckthorn was removed and bare root seedlings and potted trees were planted in an area dominated by ash trees with pockets of reed canary grass. The seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to emerald ash borer impacts on the exiting trees. At Whalen Tract, a 55-acre site just north of the Iowa border, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, and post planting weed control. At Whitewater DNR, a 16-acre site approximately 5 miles upstream of the mouth of the Whitewater River, site preparation and direct seeding were completed. At Cannon River Bottoms State Forest, a 30-acre site near Red Wing, site preparation was completed and tree seedlings and potted trees were planted in open pockets of reed canary grass within existing forest scheduled for harvest. At Root River, a 93-acre site near La Crescent, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, direct seeding, and post planting weed control. At four of the above sites (Cannon River Collischan Road Willow project, Whitewater DNR, Root River, Whalen Tract) up to 8 acres within or near each site was also treated for reed canary grass and planted with different tree species and stock types. This was part of a LCCMR study evaluating reed canary grass control, and tree survival and growth. Evaluating success will take time. Because trees are slow growing, it can take a decade or longer for them to grow large enough to form a canopy, which will ultimately determine the success of these projects. Preliminary findings indicate initial survival of seedlings was variable. At some sites, post planting observations suggest low survival, however, small seedlings are difficult to locate in the forest understory. First year survival of bare root seedlings at the LCCMR study sites was 80-90%. Survival of potted trees at many sites was good, however there was some damage from deer. Other findings resulting from this grant included: post tree planting weed control and maintenance is essential for tree seedling survival; tree guards and deer repellent are effective at protecting trees from deer and voles; cottonwood cuttings were relatively easy to install and effective at establishing trees; swamp white oak were resilient, relatively fast growing, and resistant to deer browse making them a good choice for these sites; plantings on drier sites, with proper maintenance, take less time to establish than wetter sites; good natural regeneration can occur on some sites after exposing mineral soils; and back-up sites are needed to adjust to flooding situations which may prevent scheduled tree plantings. These findings have been incorporated into project management prescriptions. ",7/1/2014,6/30/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Tim,Schlagenhaft,The National Audubon Society,2000 W.

These forests, which provide critical habitat for forest dependent birds, are under threat from invasive species like reed canary grass. Without active management these forests will continue to decline over time. Our program focused on controlling invasive species and regenerating a variety of tree and shrub species. We prepared sites for planting or natural regeneration using herbicide, disking, or mowing; planted tree seedlings, cottonwood cuttings, or direct seeded; protected trees from deer and voles; improved tree vigor and growth through selective thinning; and controlled weeds (herbicide, mowing) after planting. Our geographic scope included the Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border, and the lower ends of major tributaries. Much of this area included state forest, Wildlife Management Areas, or National Wildlife and Fish Refuge lands. Our priorities were determined in cooperation with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Army Corps of Engineers. All projects were on public lands owned and managed by these agencies. Priorities were based on forest condition and threats, habitat needs, logistics, and access. Our goal was to prevent or control invasive species long enough to establish forest canopy and maintain a diverse forest structure that benefits birds and other wildlife. Our objectives were designed to utilize a variety of enhancement tools, monitor results, and apply that information to designing new projects. A description of each project is provided below. For several sites additional work will be completed with Phase 2 of our floodplain forest enhancement program. At Gores WMA, a 20-acre site north of Red Wing, we completed site preparation, planted bare root seedlings on 10 acres, and completed post planting weed control following tree planting on 10 additional acres that had been previously planted by US Army Corps of Engineers. At the Cannon River Collischan Road Willow Project, a 10-acre site near Red Wing, we treated reed canary grass and cut willow trees along strips to encourage aggressive expansion of willows to prevent reed canary grass encroachment into adjacent high quality floodplain forest. At Dukes Pond, a 22-acre site near Red Wing, we completed site preparation on 15 acres along the edge of existing high quality floodplain forest. Our intention was to plant trees the next fall on the treated area, but unusually high water prevented this from occurring. Bare root seedlings and potted trees had been purchased, so instead of planting the treated areas we planted 7 adjacent acres where DNR Forestry was planning a timber harvest. The planted trees will regenerate when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At North Clear Lake, a 9-acre site north of Red Wing, bare root seedlings were planted in the understory of existing floodplain forest scheduled for harvest by DNR Forestry.

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,44.654158,-93.008788

As a result of this Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council (LSOHC) grant, Dakota County focused on five conservation easements that protected 84 acres of wooded and grassland riparian areas, 26 acres of which surrounds ponds, wetlands and small lakes in the City of Rosemount, 19 acres of which are along Chub Creek in Waterford Township, and 39 acres of which are along the Vermillion River in Empire and Vermillion Townships.

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,44.660827,-93.02875

These forests, which provide critical habitat for forest dependent birds, are under threat from invasive species like reed canary grass. Without active management these forests will continue to decline over time. Our program focused on controlling invasive species and regenerating a variety of tree and shrub species. We prepared sites for planting or natural regeneration using herbicide, disking, or mowing; planted tree seedlings, cottonwood cuttings, or direct seeded; protected trees from deer and voles; improved tree vigor and growth through selective thinning; and controlled weeds (herbicide, mowing) after planting. Our geographic scope included the Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border, and the lower ends of major tributaries. Much of this area included state forest, Wildlife Management Areas, or National Wildlife and Fish Refuge lands. Our priorities were determined in cooperation with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Army Corps of Engineers. All projects were on public lands owned and managed by these agencies. Priorities were based on forest condition and threats, habitat needs, logistics, and access. Our goal was to prevent or control invasive species long enough to establish forest canopy and maintain a diverse forest structure that benefits birds and other wildlife. Our objectives were designed to utilize a variety of enhancement tools, monitor results, and apply that information to designing new projects. A description of each project is provided below. For several sites additional work will be completed with Phase 2 of our floodplain forest enhancement program. At Gores WMA, a 20-acre site north of Red Wing, we completed site preparation, planted bare root seedlings on 10 acres, and completed post planting weed control following tree planting on 10 additional acres that had been previously planted by US Army Corps of Engineers. At the Cannon River Collischan Road Willow Project, a 10-acre site near Red Wing, we treated reed canary grass and cut willow trees along strips to encourage aggressive expansion of willows to prevent reed canary grass encroachment into adjacent high quality floodplain forest. At Dukes Pond, a 22-acre site near Red Wing, we completed site preparation on 15 acres along the edge of existing high quality floodplain forest. Our intention was to plant trees the next fall on the treated area, but unusually high water prevented this from occurring. Bare root seedlings and potted trees had been purchased, so instead of planting the treated areas we planted 7 adjacent acres where DNR Forestry was planning a timber harvest. The planted trees will regenerate when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At North Clear Lake, a 9-acre site north of Red Wing, bare root seedlings were planted in the understory of existing floodplain forest scheduled for harvest by DNR Forestry. The planted trees will give a head start to regeneration when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At East Indian Creek Delta, a 55-acre site north of Weaver, site preparation was completed and tree and shrub seedlings were planted in an area dominated by ash trees. Shade tolerant seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to the death and decline of older trees. At Whitewater Delta, a 51-acre site near Weaver, buckthorn was removed and bare root seedlings and potted trees were planted in an area dominated by ash trees with pockets of reed canary grass. The seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to emerald ash borer impacts on the exiting trees. At Whalen Tract, a 55-acre site just north of the Iowa border, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, and post planting weed control. At Whitewater DNR, a 16-acre site approximately 5 miles upstream of the mouth of the Whitewater River, site preparation and direct seeding were completed. At Cannon River Bottoms State Forest, a 30-acre site near Red Wing, site preparation was completed and tree seedlings and potted trees were planted in open pockets of reed canary grass within existing forest scheduled for harvest. At Root River, a 93-acre site near La Crescent, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, direct seeding, and post planting weed control. At four of the above sites (Cannon River Collischan Road Willow project, Whitewater DNR, Root River, Whalen Tract) up to 8 acres within or near each site was also treated for reed canary grass and planted with different tree species and stock types. This was part of a LCCMR study evaluating reed canary grass control, and tree survival and growth. Evaluating success will take time. Because trees are slow growing, it can take a decade or longer for them to grow large enough to form a canopy, which will ultimately determine the success of these projects. Preliminary findings indicate initial survival of seedlings was variable. At some sites, post planting observations suggest low survival, however, small seedlings are difficult to locate in the forest understory. First year survival of bare root seedlings at the LCCMR study sites was 80-90%. Survival of potted trees at many sites was good, however there was some damage from deer. Other findings resulting from this grant included: post tree planting weed control and maintenance is essential for tree seedling survival; tree guards and deer repellent are effective at protecting trees from deer and voles; cottonwood cuttings were relatively easy to install and effective at establishing trees; swamp white oak were resilient, relatively fast growing, and resistant to deer browse making them a good choice for these sites; plantings on drier sites, with proper maintenance, take less time to establish than wetter sites; good natural regeneration can occur on some sites after exposing mineral soils; and back-up sites are needed to adjust to flooding situations which may prevent scheduled tree plantings. These findings have been incorporated into project management prescriptions. ",7/1/2014,6/30/2019,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Tim,Schlagenhaft,The National Audubon Society,2000 W.

Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,44.66287,-93.081568

Result 1 (4f2.9) focused on a trout stream habitat restoration project located within Vermillion River Aquatic Management Areas (AMA), in Dakota County. This stretch of the Vermillion River channel had been altered by ditching. Result 2 (4f3.5) focused on securing fee title parcels on the Vermillion River in Dakota County and Eagle Creek in Scott County. Parcels include habitat linkages that provided environmental protection of the shoreline and riparian zone, exhibit a high risk of development, supply angler access, and afford management access necessary for implementing habitat improvement projects. Project goals were to restore 0.6 miles of stream habitat and acquire 60 acres with 1.0 mile of shoreline. Partner funding includes donations of land value and cash. Result 1 (4f2.9): Restoration of 0.9 miles of Vermillion River channel. Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF) dollars directly restored approximately 0.44 miles of the total restored channel. Other State dollars (TU OHC = $140,000) restored 0.41 miles, and other funding (Vermillion River Watershed = $20,000) restored 0.05 miles of the total. Result 2 (4f3.5): Acquisition of four parcels with a grand total of approximately 50.5 acres and 1.1 miles of stream shoreline. Because of the extreme variation in shoreline values it is hard to accurately predict a reliable acre benchmark. Most years, including the 2008 ENRTF appropriation, we far exceeded our acres goal. For the 2009 ENRTF appropriation, we fell short of the acres goal, but reached our ""miles of shoreline"" goal. ENRTF directly acquired approximately 38.8 acres of the total, including 0.7 miles stream shoreline. Donations of land value (""other funds"" $106,800) accounted for 11.7 acres and 0.4 shoreline miles. One of the Vermillion River parcels (parcel 7) was acquired jointly using both 2008 and 2009 grants to Metro Corridors Conservation Partnership. Results for Vermillion River, P7 were proportionately distributed for each grant. Overall, as a result of this project, 0.9 miles of Vermillion River channel was restored to its original course, after being ditched for 50 or more years. Also, as a result of this project, 50.5 acres, including 1.1 miles of critical shoreline fish and wildlife habitat are now permanently protected and open to public angling and/or hunting - as well as other light use recreational activities. Due to failed negotiations, two acquisitions went into abeyance towards the end of the grant, resulting in $57,975 being turned back to the ENRTF.

The middle 800 feet of the ravine had previously been stabilized by the City. However, a $130,000 Clean Water Fund grant from BWSR as well as a $20,000 grant from the Scott WMO, also allowed the City to reconstruct and stabilize the lower 1,100 feet of the ravine. This allowed reconstruction of the entire 2,600-foot ravine from Utica Avenue all the way to the Credit River. This project, with significant support from project partners reduced sediment discharge to the Credit River by an estimated 50 tons per year, improved public safety and converted the ravine to a neighborhood amenity.

Through one of the most ambitious Common Carp management efforts in the state, the program will improve fisheries and benefit waterfowl and non-game bird communities, improving recreation for fisherman, hunters and bird-watchers.","The Six Mile Creek-Halsted Bay (SMCHB) subwatershed is a 27 square mile geography in the western metro spanning Carver and Hennepin Counties. The subwatershed includes 14 deep and shallow lakes, totaling 2,488 acres, and over 2,900 acres of wetlands. Carver Park Reserve is situated entirely within this subwatershed, providing 5,700 acres of permanently protected open water, wetland, forest, and prairie habitat. Much of the subwatershed is designated as DNR Regionally Significant Ecological Area. The complex of deep and shallow lakes and wetlands are connected through a 12 mile stream system that drains to Halsted Bay, the most impaired water body on Lake Minnetonka - the most heavily used recreation lake in the State.Habitat for fish, birds and waterfowl has been degraded through much of this system, the results of overabundant common carp and historic agricultural land use, with users reporting decreased fishing success in Halsted Bay. Restoring this system is a priority for the District and its partners within the region (Cities of Victoria, St. Bonifacius, Minnetrista, and Waconia, Laketown Township, Carver and Hennepin Counties, and Three Rivers Park District). Together, this group is committed to aligning priorities and investments across agencies to accomplish large scale habitat, corridor, and water resource restoration objectives over the next 10-15 years.Habitat improvements throughout this system will principally involve restoration of lake and marsh habitats through management of common carp,and the restoration of wetland and contiguous uplands to enhance and connect natural resource corridors.The Common Carp management approach for SMCHB was developed based on a three-year, half-million dollar District investment with the University of Minnesota AIS Research Center from 2014-2017, which provided a cutting-edge scientific assessment of common carp populations, reproduction and migratory patterns in the geography. This assessment revealed some of the largest carp population densities ever observed by the center. Proposed Common Carp management includes:-Aerating 6 shallow marsh areas known to winterkill, to promote bluegill sunfish survivability and prevent carp recruitment.-Physical barriers at 4 locations to block carp from accessing spawning areas. The barrier between Mud and Halsted will also trap carp for removal.-Install a water control structure and barrier between two shallow lake systems to have the ability to block carp passage and manipulate water levels to eliminate carp recruitment and maintain healthy shallow lake systems.-Remove adult carp through winter or open water seining, box-net trapping, and removing carp in stream channels.This carp management approach will results in 2,488 acres of restored deep and shallow lakes, of which 66% is littoral habitat. Carp control will allow for the restoration of invertebrate and aquatic plant communities to the benefit of gamefish such as Bass, panfish and northern pike communities, as well as non-game fish and waterfowl, providing hunters and fisherman better opportunities to enjoy the region’s outdoor heritage.

Through one of the most ambitious Common Carp management efforts in the state, the program will improve fisheries and benefit waterfowl and non-game bird communities, improving recreation for fisherman, hunters and bird-watchers.","The Six Mile Creek-Halsted Bay (SMCHB) subwatershed is a 27 square mile geography in the western metro spanning Carver and Hennepin Counties. The subwatershed includes 14 deep and shallow lakes, totaling 2,488 acres, and over 2,900 acres of wetlands. Carver Park Reserve is situated entirely within this subwatershed, providing 5,700 acres of permanently protected open water, wetland, forest, and prairie habitat. Much of the subwatershed is designated as DNR Regionally Significant Ecological Area. The complex of deep and shallow lakes and wetlands are connected through a 12 mile stream system that drains to Halsted Bay, the most impaired water body on Lake Minnetonka - the most heavily used recreation lake in the State.Habitat for fish, birds and waterfowl has been degraded through much of this system, the results of overabundant common carp and historic agricultural land use, with users reporting decreased fishing success in Halsted Bay. Restoring this system is a priority for the District and its partners within the region (Cities of Victoria, St. Bonifacius, Minnetrista, and Waconia, Laketown Township, Carver and Hennepin Counties, and Three Rivers Park District). Together, this group is committed to aligning priorities and investments across agencies to accomplish large scale habitat, corridor, and water resource restoration objectives over the next 10-15 years.Habitat improvements throughout this system will principally involve restoration of lake and marsh habitats through management of common carp,and the restoration of wetland and contiguous uplands to enhance and connect natural resource corridors.The Common Carp management approach for SMCHB was developed based on a three-year, half-million dollar District investment with the University of Minnesota AIS Research Center from 2014-2017, which provided a cutting-edge scientific assessment of common carp populations, reproduction and migratory patterns in the geography. This assessment revealed some of the largest carp population densities ever observed by the center. Proposed Common Carp management includes:-Aerating 6 shallow marsh areas known to winterkill, to promote bluegill sunfish survivability and prevent carp recruitment.-Physical barriers at 4 locations to block carp from accessing spawning areas. The barrier between Mud and Halsted will also trap carp for removal.-Install a water control structure and barrier between two shallow lake systems to have the ability to block carp passage and manipulate water levels to eliminate carp recruitment and maintain healthy shallow lake systems.-Remove adult carp through winter or open water seining, box-net trapping, and removing carp in stream channels.This carp management approach will results in 2,488 acres of restored deep and shallow lakes, of which 66% is littoral habitat. Carp control will allow for the restoration of invertebrate and aquatic plant communities to the benefit of gamefish such as Bass, panfish and northern pike communities, as well as non-game fish and waterfowl, providing hunters and fisherman better opportunities to enjoy the region’s outdoor heritage.

Non-OHF funds were applied to complete feasibility and design in order to optimize application of construction funds. The resulting sheltered bay provides critical coastal wetland habitat for many species of fish and wildlife that utilize the St. Louis River estuary. Wild rice was also established in the bay after construction as part of the separate Wild Rice Restoration Project.Prior to restoration activities, wood waste covered almost the entire open-water portion of the bay. Wood waste was also present under areas of emergent vegetation. Depth of wood waste ranged from 0.2 feet to 3.3 feet. The average water depth was approximately one foot. Although the bay was relatively shallow, submergent and emergent vegetation were only present along the perimeter of the bay. Shallow water depths also limited ecological function of the bay as well as its recreational value to anglers and other boaters.Approximately 115,000 cubic yards of wood waste and wood sediment mixes were removed from Radio Tower Bay. The material was pumped to a dewatering site on US Steel property and was beneficially reused to restore their Superfund site after remediation. The Project resulted in increasing the average water depth of the bay from one foot to 3.7 feet and increased the maximum depth from 2.3 feet to 7.4 feet. A 5.5-acre area with an average water depth of 7.5 feet and channel depth of 5.0 feet will act as a connection between the St. Louis River and the bay, which creates off-river, overwintering fish habitat and improves access for boaters. The bed of Radio Tower Bay is now composed of native silt, unconsolidated organic matter, and clay substrates that have been exposed by the removal of wood waste. Wild Rice was seeded in approximately 15 acres of Radio Tower Bay in 2015 and 2016. Previously seeding areas will be reseeded in 2017 if necessary.All objectives were met and all construction activities went as planned. The technique to grind up wood and sediment mixes and hydraulically pump them to a dewatering facility for drying was revolutionary. The resulting clean organic material was deemed highly desirable as a substrate to restore remediated areas on the US Steel Superfund Site. After removal of material, the dewatering facility will continue to function and will be used to dewater wood waste from Mud Lake (ML2018 OHF proposal), which will substantially reduce the cost of the project.Knowlton CreekThe Knowlton Creek Watershed Project restored and enhanced approximately 6,500 linear feet of cold-water stream habitat using Natural Channel Design techniques. Construction outcomes were successful in eliminating erosion and transport of sediment along all reaches restored. Brook trout migration was established or enhanced along 3,000 feet of the stream (the remaining length was too steep). The Project was completed after Spirit Mountain Recreation Area constructed water control structures at the base of their ski hill to transport excess runoff away from Knowlton Creek and directly to the estuary through the pipe used to transport water from the estuary for snow making. This was a revolutionary partnership and methodology. The Project was designed through a MNDNR/USACE partnership with no OHF funding. The restoration methodology applied was a geomorphologic approach appropriate for the hydrology following the Natural Channel Design methodology (Applied River Morphology, Rosgen, 1996).Construction of in-stream structures (boulder jam steps, boulder jam riffles, toe wood, pocket pools and log vanes with boulder hooks) will improve aquatic habitat diversity and stabilize the bed. Native upland grasses and forbes were planted as well as approximately 15,000 trees along the riparian corridor. During construction, MNDNR, Stantech, Veit/Cardno’s field staff worked together to compile construction observation reports and note deviations from the site plans. Overall, the project implementation partners were very effective at addressing project level circumstances. There were a number of design changes that resulted from conditions encountered in the field. Coordination with project partners such as the City of Duluth, Cloquet Pumping Station, Spirit Mountain, MNDOT, private landowners, as well as, resource professionals within the MNDNR, MPCA and USACE was key to the success of the project. In some instances, earlier coordination of the more critical elements of the project would have eliminated some of the additional implementation time needed to complete the restoration.21st Ave W/Interstate IslandThe scope of Interstate Island was to restore colonial waterbird nesting and young rearing habitat through the addition of sand and gravel, vegetation management, and management of the ring-billed population, thereby contributing to implementation of Actions 1.32 and 1.361 in the Recovery Plan for the Great Lakes Piping Plover. Reproductive success of Common Terns nesting on Interstate Island was degraded due to the low elevation of part of the island, vegetation encroachment, and competition for nesting space from ring-billed gulls.The Project was designed by MNDNR with no OHF funding. The contractor placed 730 linear feet of temporary silt fencing, 3,276 cubic yards of clean beach sand, 610 cubic yards of cobble rip-rap, 28 cubic yards of surface amendments (pebbles & gravel), and 620 linear feet of sediment control log. MN & WDNR staff and volunteers removed all fenced gull exclosures and string grids prior to construction. These were replaced in spring of 2016 as part of regular departmental Piping Plover/Common Tern monitoring and management efforts. Common Terns have been successfully using the enhanced habitat since the Project was completed.Wild Rice (Rask Bay)A total of 133 acres of wild rice was restored at several locations in the St. Louis River estuary in 2015 and 2016. Previously seeded location were reseeded in 2017 as needed. Additionally, WDNR and the MN Land Trust restored 83 acres of wild rice beds on the Wisconsin side of the estuary. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation applied $400K and no OHF funding was applied to restoration work on the Wisconsin side of the estuary. A total of 216 acres is in the process of being restored on both sides of the estuary as part of this cooperative project between WDNR and MNDNR. Yearly monitoring and reports are being completed to evaluate all previously seeded locations and determine additional sites for implementation in future years.

Wood waste was also present under areas of emergent vegetation. Depth of wood waste ranged from 0.2 feet to 3.3 feet. The average water depth was approximately one foot. Although the bay was relatively shallow, submergent and emergent vegetation were only present along the perimeter of the bay. Shallow water depths also limited ecological function of the bay as well as its recreational value to anglers and other boaters.Approximately 115,000 cubic yards of wood waste and wood sediment mixes were removed from Radio Tower Bay. The material was pumped to a dewatering site on US Steel property and was beneficially reused to restore their Superfund site after remediation. The Project resulted in increasing the average water depth of the bay from one foot to 3.7 feet and increased the maximum depth from 2.3 feet to 7.4 feet. A 5.5-acre area with an average water depth of 7.5 feet and channel depth of 5.0 feet will act as a connection between the St. Louis River and the bay, which creates off-river, overwintering fish habitat and improves access for boaters. The bed of Radio Tower Bay is now composed of native silt, unconsolidated organic matter, and clay substrates that have been exposed by the removal of wood waste. Wild Rice was seeded in approximately 15 acres of Radio Tower Bay in 2015 and 2016. Previously seeding areas will be reseeded in 2017 if necessary.All objectives were met and all construction activities went as planned. The technique to grind up wood and sediment mixes and hydraulically pump them to a dewatering facility for drying was revolutionary. The resulting clean organic material was deemed highly desirable as a substrate to restore remediated areas on the US Steel Superfund Site. After removal of material, the dewatering facility will continue to function and will be used to dewater wood waste from Mud Lake (ML2018 OHF proposal), which will substantially reduce the cost of the project.Knowlton CreekThe Knowlton Creek Watershed Project restored and enhanced approximately 6,500 linear feet of cold-water stream habitat using Natural Channel Design techniques. Construction outcomes were successful in eliminating erosion and transport of sediment along all reaches restored. Brook trout migration was established or enhanced along 3,000 feet of the stream (the remaining length was too steep). The Project was completed after Spirit Mountain Recreation Area constructed water control structures at the base of their ski hill to transport excess runoff away from Knowlton Creek and directly to the estuary through the pipe used to transport water from the estuary for snow making. This was a revolutionary partnership and methodology. The Project was designed through a MNDNR/USACE partnership with no OHF funding. The restoration methodology applied was a geomorphologic approach appropriate for the hydrology following the Natural Channel Design methodology (Applied River Morphology, Rosgen, 1996).Construction of in-stream structures (boulder jam steps, boulder jam riffles, toe wood, pocket pools and log vanes with boulder hooks) will improve aquatic habitat diversity and stabilize the bed. Native upland grasses and forbes were planted as well as approximately 15,000 trees along the riparian corridor. During construction, MNDNR, Stantech, Veit/Cardno’s field staff worked together to compile construction observation reports and note deviations from the site plans. Overall, the project implementation partners were very effective at addressing project level circumstances. There were a number of design changes that resulted from conditions encountered in the field. Coordination with project partners such as the City of Duluth, Cloquet Pumping Station, Spirit Mountain, MNDOT, private landowners, as well as, resource professionals within the MNDNR, MPCA and USACE was key to the success of the project. In some instances, earlier coordination of the more critical elements of the project would have eliminated some of the additional implementation time needed to complete the restoration.21st Ave W/Interstate IslandThe scope of Interstate Island was to restore colonial waterbird nesting and young rearing habitat through the addition of sand and gravel, vegetation management, and management of the ring-billed population, thereby contributing to implementation of Actions 1.32 and 1.361 in the Recovery Plan for the Great Lakes Piping Plover. Reproductive success of Common Terns nesting on Interstate Island was degraded due to the low elevation of part of the island, vegetation encroachment, and competition for nesting space from ring-billed gulls.The Project was designed by MNDNR with no OHF funding. The contractor placed 730 linear feet of temporary silt fencing, 3,276 cubic yards of clean beach sand, 610 cubic yards of cobble rip-rap, 28 cubic yards of surface amendments (pebbles & gravel), and 620 linear feet of sediment control log. MN & WDNR staff and volunteers removed all fenced gull exclosures and string grids prior to construction. These were replaced in spring of 2016 as part of regular departmental Piping Plover/Common Tern monitoring and management efforts. Common Terns have been successfully using the enhanced habitat since the Project was completed.Wild Rice (Rask Bay)A total of 133 acres of wild rice was restored at several locations in the St. Louis River estuary in 2015 and 2016. Previously seeded location were reseeded in 2017 as needed. Additionally, WDNR and the MN Land Trust restored 83 acres of wild rice beds on the Wisconsin side of the estuary. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation applied $400K and no OHF funding was applied to restoration work on the Wisconsin side of the estuary. A total of 216 acres is in the process of being restored on both sides of the estuary as part of this cooperative project between WDNR and MNDNR. Yearly monitoring and reports are being completed to evaluate all previously seeded locations and determine additional sites for implementation in future years.

Nearly 100 years ago much of the stream was straightened and dredged to provide better drainage for agriculture. As agriculture gave way to urban and suburban development, Shingle Creek was widened and dredged again to more efficiently convey stormwater to the Mississippi River. Urbanization has resulted in high levels of chloride in the stream from road salt and not enough dissolved oxygen to sustain aquatic life. In 2011, with the assistance of a Clean Water Legacy Grant, the City of Brooklyn Center, the Shingle Creek Watershed Management Commission, and Hennepin Community Works, Shingle Creek in Brooklyn Center between I-94 and County Road 10 will be improved with in-stream water quality and habitat enhancements, native vegetation buffers, rain gardens, enhanced landscaping, and streambank stabilization.

9817,Marsh Lake Enhancement,2013,2630000,"ML 2012, Ch. 264, Art. 1, Sec. 2, Subd. 4(f)","$2,630,000 in the second year is to the commissioner of natural resources to complete design and construction to modify the dam at Marsh Lake and return the historic outlet of the Pomme de Terre River to Lac Qui Parle. ",,"Enhance 5,100 acres of wetlands ",,8478000,Federal Funds ,2630000,,,,DNR,State Government,"The primary goal of the Marsh Lake Ecosystem Restoration Project is, “To return the Marsh Lake area ecosystem to a less degraded and more natural condition by restoring ecosystem structure and functions.”  Work was completed on this project in March 2020 and consisted of a new water control structure to allow for water level management, restoration of the Pomme de Terre River to its original channel, and establishment of a fishway to allow for movement of native fish. ",,"Marsh Lake is an impoundment of the Minnesota River in west-central Minnesota near Appleton. Marsh Lake was created in the late 1930s by construction of a dam which resulted in a shallow lake that measured approximately 5,000 acres. The lower Pomme de Terre River was rerouted into the reservoir at that time to facilitate construction of a two mile long earthen dike that was required to impound the lake. The Marsh Lake Dam is owned and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Lac qui Parle Flood Risk Management project. Marsh Lake lies within the State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Lac qui Parle Wildlife Management Area.Marsh Lake is the border between Big Stone and Lac qui Parle Counties, while most of the outlet area of Marsh Lake is located in Swift County. The original construction of the Marsh Lake Dam was intended to serve as a flood damage reduction measure and to provide a recreational feature to the region by creating a static pool on the river. The intended flood damage reduction benefits provided by the Marsh Lake Dam were minor due to effectiveness of the downstream Lac qui Parle Dam. Since the time of impoundment, Marsh Lake has undergone significant degradation of aquatic habitat due to stressors including high sediment and nutrient loading, a fixed crest dam that prevents low seasonal water levels, high turbidity from wind-driven sediment resuspension, and abundant common carp that increase turbidity and consume submersed aquatic vegetation and macroinvertebrates. Degradation of the Marsh Lake aquatic ecosystem limited habitat suitability for many species of fish and wildlife. The overall habitat conditions were poor with turbid water conditions. Concerns by stakeholders over the habitat conditions eventually resulted in the Marsh Lake Ecosystem Restoration Project with a primary goal of improving fish and wildlife habitat by returning the Marsh Lake to a less degraded and more natural condition with snatural functions and processes. Major project features include construction of a drawdown water control structure, restoring the Pomme de Terre River to its original channel, modifying the existing low-head dam into a notched weir/rock arch rapids fishway, and construction of one mile of new roadway/earthen dike. The project also restores 1.3 miles of natural stream habitat and provides complete fish passage from the Minnesota River into Marsh Lake. . Water Control Structure - The drawdown structure was constructed west of the existing emergency spillway. Excavation for the structure’s outflow channel extended about 650 feet downstream of the embankment. The intake for the structure required excavation to deepen the approach and placement of new rip‐rap to protect the structure. Sheetpile was buried under the concrete structure to minimize seepage. A 60‐ft long section of the channel bed immediately downstream of the concrete spillway was lined with a 33‐inch layer of rip‐rap over 12‐inch bedding. A 100‐ft long dredge maintenance access ramp was built from the top of the west embankment into Marsh Lake. The new water control structure will allow for water levels to be manipulated between and within years to promote habitat benefits, as has been successfully done on numerous shallow lakes across Minnesota and on Mississippi River pools. Variability in water levels has resulted in increased extent, diversity, and abundance of aquatic vegetation, increased food for waterfowl, and improved water quality conditions.   Re-routing of the Pomme de Terre River - The Pomme de Terre River was successfully re-routed into it's historic channel.  Two rock riffle structures were utilized to prevent head‐cutting in the river channel. Riffles were placed to traverse the entire river channel and were constructed with boulders, rip‐rap, and gravel. This provides a drop in the water surface elevation of about 8 inches.  The 1,000 feet of the bank of the Pomme de Terre River has been stabilized using toe wood sod mats. Large trees were placed in an interlocking matrix and anchored with boulders. Topsoil or soil mats were placed to fill the areas between trees and branches and shrubs and live willow cuttings were added.  An estimated 1.1 miles of existing roadway was removed as part of re-storing the Pomme de Terre River and its floodplain. Successful re-routing of the river now means the sediment and nutrients carried by the Pomme de Terre River no longer are emptied into Marsh Lake, but are instead diverted into the Minnesota River below the water control structure. Fishway - The fishway was constructed from the current spillway and extends about 300 feet downstream at a 3% slope. Boulder weirs were spaced 20 feet apart, with each achieving individual 10‐inch drops. The fishway ranges in width from 150 feet at the dam to 200 feet wide at the downstream edge. Approximately 1,579 cubic yards of large (1.6 ft diameter and larger boulders for weirs) were used in the fishway channel. The goal of the components listed above is to partially or fully reestablish the attributes of a naturally functioning and self-regulating system. The expected outcomes of the Marsh Lake project are to: (1) reduce sediment loading to Marsh Lake; (2) restore natural fluctuations to the hydrologic regime of Marsh Lake; (3) restore geomorphic and floodplain processes to the Pomme de Terre River; (4) reduce sediment resuspension within Marsh Lake; (5) increase extent, diversity, and abundance of emergent and submersed aquatic plant growth in Marsh Lake; (6) increase the availability of waterfowl and native fish habitat; (7) restore aquatic habitat connectivity between Marsh Lake, the Pomme de Terre River, and Lac qui Parle Lake; (8) reduce the abundance of aquatic invasive fish species in Marsh Lake; and (9) increase diversity and abundance of native fishes within Marsh Lake and the Pomme de Terre River. This project is designed to restore a more natural and variable hydrologic regime which is important to restoring freshwater aquatic ecosystems within Marsh Lake. On a river floodplain lake like Marsh Lake, a more natural hydrologic regime includes lower lake levels in some years to provide conditions conducive for aquatic vegetation to establish. In the event the goals in the Marsh Lake Ecosystem Restoration Plan are not achieved through the passive water control structure (i.e., fishway), a water level drawdown structure has been incorporated into the project where water levels could be drawn down according to recommendations and implementation by the adaptive management team. Annual and intra-annual variations in water levels are extremely important to maintain ecosystem functions in these shallow water systems. In other areas, (e.g., the pools in the Upper Mississippi River), variability in water levels has resulted in increased extent, diversity, and abundance of aquatic vegetation, increased food for waterfowl, and improved water quality conditions. The DNR Section of Wildlife has completed other projects to enhance habitat and water quality conditions within shallow lake systems through active water level drawdowns. A clear water system with more aquatic plants would favor native fishes over the non-native Common carp, as well as favor many other native plant and wildlife species. The proposed project will provide habitat improvement and improve water quality conditions in Marsh Lake. This restoration of ecosystem functions would improve fish and wildlife habitat, water quality, and provide more public use opportunities. Specific beneficiaries include sport anglers, waterfowl hunters, wildlife viewers, and downstream users who benefit from increased water quality downstream through the Minnesota River.   Water quality benefits will result from the completed work and from the future management that is now possible.  Rerouting of the Pomme de Terre into a meandering channel with adjacent floodplain habitat can provide some limited ability for sediment reduction as it flows into the Minnesota River.  Significant water quality benefits will result from the current ongoing drawdown of Marsh Lake, along with any future drawdowns.  Past experience with drawdowns of shallow lakes shows that the bottom-sediment consolidation and increased submergent vegetation provide significant water quality benefits both in the shallow lake and in downstream waters. Note that the ""Performance Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan"" is attached to this Final Report and details the extensive monitoring that will be conducted on this project to determine progress towards goals. While COVID-19 restrictions have limited some initial monitoring, anecdotal reports from local staff reveal exciting developments related to the water level drawdown that was immediately initiated following completion of project construction - - From Walt Gessler (Lac qui Parle Area Wildlife Supervisor)  -  ""I was able to remotely recruit several experienced birders earlier this year to make observations of shorebird use of Marsh Lake this spring and summer and thought you be interested in some recent counts that were made.7/19/20 Louisburg Grade:  150 Killdeer, 4 Semipalmated Plovers, 40 Stilt Sandpipers, 30 Bairds Sandpipers, 100 Least Sandpiper, 460 Pectoral Sanpiper, 10 semipalmated Sandpipers, 20 Short-billed Dowitcher, 30 Spotted Sandpiper, 1450 Lesser Yellowlegs, 15 Greater Yellowlegs, 15 Wilsons Phalaropes.  2324 Total;     Correll Access:  2 American Avocets, 200 Killdeer, 172 Stilt Sandpipers, 15 Baird’s Sandpipers, 1280 Least Sandpipers, 340 Pectoal Sandpipers, 30 semi-palmated Sandpipers, 25 Short-billed Dowitcher, 30 spotted Sandpipers, 1800 Lesser Yellowlegs, 20 Greater Yellowlegs, 14 Wilson Phaloropes.   3928 total"" - From Ray Norrgard (DNR Wetland Specialist, retired)  08/21/2020 -  ""Walt gave me a tour yesterday, the drawdown looks good with extensive mudflats; thousands of shorebirds and teal.

A list of proposed enhancements must be provided as part of the required accomplishment plan. ","A network of natural land and riparian habitats will connect corridors for wildlife and species in greatest conservation need - This project will allow us to reconnect gaps in Rum River riparian-littoral habitat currently fragmented and missing due to eroded riverbank. Over seven miles of this missing habitat was identified during an ACD Rum River erosion inventory. Up to 2.55 acres of habitat along 2,250 feet of Rum River shoreline will be enhanced with this funding",,,205700,"Anoka County, Rum WMOs and Landowner",816000,,,0.481,Anoka County Soil and Water Conservation District,Local/Regional Government,"In partnership with Anoka County and landowners, Anoka Conservation District will enhance Rum River habitat by utilizing eco-sensitive, habitat-building, bioengineering approaches to address active bank erosion on three to seven reaches. Sediment delivered from bank erosion threatens fish and mussel reproduction. The Rum River is a state designated Outstanding Resource Value Water and Wild, Scenic and Recreational River with eighty actively failing riverbanks in Anoka County alone. Project partners will address these in a phased approach utilizing CWF, LSOHC, and CPL funds. LSOHC funds will be used for projects that primarily enhance habitat, including for species in greatest conservation need.","Eighty sites spanning seven miles of actively eroding riverbank were identified along the Rum River in Anoka County, an Outstanding Resource Value Water and Wild, Scenic and Recreational River. Identified bank failures contribute an estimated 7,838 tons of sediment to the river annually, which decimates littoral transitional habitat, smothers fish spawning areas, compromises mussel reproduction and vigor, and reduces success of predatory game fish species due to increased turbidity. The Anoka Conservation District (ACD), along with Anoka County and landowners, proposes to systematically stabilize and enhance these damaged riverbanks. In total this undertaking will require a projected $14 million in public and private funds, drawing upon several grant funding sources, and spanning multiple grant cycles. An inventory of active erosion sites was finalized in March of 2019 by ACD (https://www.anokaswcd.org/images/AnokaSWCD/Reports/Inventory/Rum_River_Erosion_Inventory_Final.pdf). Based on erosion severity, sites were assigned one of three stabilization approaches, which align with one of three state funding sources. Seventeen tall, severely eroding riverbanks require armament, have a primary benefit of water quality improvement, and will be addressed with CWF funding. Twenty-one shorter, moderately eroding riverbanks can be corrected utilizing bioengineering approaches, have a primary benefit of habitat enhancement, and will be addressed with LSOHC funds. Forty-two short, moderately eroding riverbanks can be corrected utilizing cedar tree revetments and will be addressed with CPL funds. This grant request is for ACD, in partnership with Anoka County, to enhance three to seven sites over three years that can be addressed using bioengineering approaches such as bendway weirs and root wads that produce in-stream habitat for fish, turtles and amphibians, native plantings and staking that produce riparian habitat above the water, and light toe armoring and minor grading that make these habitats traversable by wildlife. Sites will be prioritized considering linear feet of habitat enhanced, cost-benefit analysis, landowner buy-in, and accessibility. Phase-1 projects will enhance up to 2,250 feet of habitat, and reduce sediment loads to the Rum River by up to 630 tons/year. Riverbank stabilization design and installation processes can present hazards to some wildlife; namely nearshore mussels, amphibians and reptiles during construction, and reptiles and amphibians that are unable to safely traverse the post-construction stabilization materials and plantings. As part of this project, ACD intends work with experts in the field to conceptualize, design and implement approaches to best abate these hazards, with particular attention on species in greatest conservation need (SGCN) such as state-listed mussels and Blanding's turtles. The Rum River is identified as a key river stretch for habitat and species richness for SGCN through Anoka County. Large portions of critical streambank transitional habitat that these species depend on are gone already, with more lost each year. The number of optimal sites for habitat enhancing bioengineering approaches is limited, and will continue to diminish if left unchecked. Inventory work by ACD shed light on the severity of the issue and the scale of the opportunity to take corrective action.",,7/1/2020,,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Chris,Lord,Anoka Conservation District,"1318 McKay Dr. NE, Suite 300 ",Ham Lake,MN,55304,(763) 434-2030,Chris.Lord@anokaswcd.org,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,Anoka,Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/rum-river-wildlife-and-fish-habitat-enhancement-using-bioengineered-bank-stabilization,,,,,45.268105,-93.402064

LSSA used the new MPCA and Natural Channel Design evaluation criteria to rank and prioritize locations (reaches) for rehabilitation in the upper Knife River watershed. Phase III will work on the top 30% of Reach 4. Phase III focus will be stabilizing streambanks, installation of instream habitat and replanting riparian forest. Only stream sections located on public lands and private lands with DNR easements will be considered for work. See the LSSA supplementary video for more information.","The Knife River watershed once held one of the largest populations of natural reproducing steelhead in the Great Lakes. Since the late 1970’s, the Knife River steelhead population has seen a dramatic decline. One major reason for this decline is habitat loss. Habitat loss is a long-term result from historic logging. The pre-settlement forest composition within the Knife River watershed consisted of old growth coniferous trees. Extensive logging removed these trees throughout the watershed, which were replaced by large stands of second growth aspen. This large-scale forest alteration removed the large trees that stabilized the stream banks and attracted unprecedented beaver populations to the watershed due to the new aspen food source. This combination has led to a rapidly deteriorating riparian zone that now includes slumping stream banks, dead trees and remnant beaver meadows. The slumping clay banks have also resulted in a TMDL excedance for turbidity on the Knife River. Recognizing the threat to the upper river, the DNR started performing limited stream studies. These studies have determined that habitat degradation in the watershed has resulted in poor rearing conditions for juvenile trout.The goal of Phase III is to rehabilitate stream banks, wetlands, fish habitat and riparian zone trees that have been impacted over the past 100 years. The LSSA used a combination of aerial data (LIDAR) and river surveys to locate and assess impacted stream areas within the Knife River watershed. A field reconnaissance and detailed stream survey using MPCA and Natural Channel Assessment methodology determined the stream’s condition. Reach 4 (Upper Main Knife River) was ranked very high for a rehabilitation project. Rehabilitation of Reach 4 will be conducted by using design/build construction following Natural Channel Design criteria to achieve a stable stream reach. Phase III will rehabilitate approximately the top 30% of the entire Reach 4 complex. Our scope of work may include:* Survey the stream using MPCA and NCD methodology.* Conduct baseline and periodic stream and biological data collection and monitoring on impact areas.* Track fish movement within the watershed.* Monitor water temperature/quality.* Conduct fish shocking.* Identify erosion areas.* Measure streamflow.* Complete permit applications* Meet with regulators to receive project approvals.* Conduct stakeholder meetings.* Remove log jams/beaver blockages to restore connectivity.* Restore stream flow.* Create and restore wetlands and off-channel ponds.* Perform design/build projects to stabilize streambanks, restore channels and install woody debris using natural channel methodology.* Remove impounded silt and sediments from the streambed.* Planting trees and shrubs to restore the overhead canopy.* Increase spawning/rearing habitat.* Add large woody debris, rock vanes and “J” hooks into the stream.* Post construction survey.By LSOHC recommendation, Zeitgeist and LSSA are partnering in Phase III of this project to meet all of the shared environmental and administrative objectives.

In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1).

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Minnesota may be the Land of 10,000 lakes, but often overlooked are its over 69,000 miles of streams. From small trout streams to the mighty Mississippi, streams support a wealth of biodiversity and also provide excellent fishing opportunities. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as Southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers can pursue.Minnesota streams host 162 fish species and 48 mussel species, of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. Streams in Minnesota have been degraded through a history of alterations to the streams themselves by channelization (straightening), poor riparian management, and fragmentation by barriers such as dams. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) works to restore or enhance habitat to address these impacts, benefiting fish, mussels, and other aquatic life. However, department resources for stream habitat work fall far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department. In past rounds of OHF, stream habitat has been part of a larger MNDNR package of aquatic habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement projects. In this round we have chosen to create a proposal focused solely on stream restoration and enhancement, with aquatic habitat protection in a separate proposal.One of the biggest limitations to fish and mussel species is the fragmentation of rivers. Dams and other obstructions block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas. The juvenile life stage of mussels spends it's first weeks of life on the gills of a fish, and relies on that fish to transport it upstream to hospitable habitats. Barriers can lead to the loss of fish and mussel species above dams, and reduce populations living below them. Often dams and other barriers are not longer serving their intended function and can be removed. In cases where the dam is still functioning, the structure can be modified to allow fish passage. Examples of modifications include projects that have converted dams into rapids, and construction of nature-like fishways around or over dams.A case study in the benefits of fish passage is the removal of a dam on the Pomme de Terre River in Appleton, MN. Following removal, 10 fish species including walleye and channel catfish have returned to 42 upstream miles of river that became accessible. Mussel species have also benefited, with two native mussel species now found in areas upstream of the dam where formerly they had been absent. Another example is the modification of the Heidberg Dam on the Wild Rice River to allow fish passage, where 10 fish species including walleye, sauger, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass are now found where they had formerly been absent, as far as 75 miles upstream of the dam. These case studies show that although the footprint of fish passage projects is small (typically only a few acres) and the cost per acre appears high, the benefits go far beyond the project site. We can impact miles of stream in a single project, and the benefits will endure.Some proposed fish passage projects target species living in lakes that use streams for spawning. Many species including northern pike, walleye, suckers, and numerous minnow species migrate out of lakes and into streams to spawn before returning to the lake. On many lakes, the outlet has been dammed in order to stabilize water levels for property owners. These dams block fish from returning to the lake when they've finished spawning, as well as blocking their offspring from migrating to the lake when they mature.The potential for fish passage projects to enable access by invasive species has been examined for all proposed projects. None of these projects serve as a barrier between problem species such as Invasive Carp and upstream waters. Most aquatic invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels or Eurasian water milfoil) rely on other vectors such as unintentional transport by recreational boaters, rather than swimming upstream past barriers.Many streams in Minnesota have also been degraded by habitat alteration such as channelization (straightening). This simplifies the habitat and eliminates the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by different life stages of fish. Other streams have issues with bank erosion that degrade habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our package of fish passage and stream channel restoration and enhancement includes 7 projects that occur in 4 of 5 LSOHC planning regions. Although the footprint of projects is 22 acres, the projects will benefit over 4,400 acres of lakes and streams (refer to Table 1) through restoration or enhancement of fish passage. Projects were selected from a prioritized list that includes factors such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. We have chosen to include parcels in this proposal above and beyond what can be accomplished with allocated funds. This will allow flexibility to complete additional projects should new sources of matching funds become available.Several of the projects on our parcel list (e.g. the Adrian Dam, and Cottonwood River dams) will involve partnership with other state agencies or local governments. Partners in many cases are local governments that own a dam proposed for removal or modification. In all cases local partners are supportive of the project, and will contribute in-kind staff time toward the projects' completion. This request also funds an ongoing stream habitat coordinator position and a part-time intern for two years. The increased work of coordinating complex stream projects funded by OHF is greater than can be handled by existing MNDNR staff. These positions create the capacity for MNDNR to effectively complete the proposed projects.",,,,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Brian,Nerbonne,MN DNR,500 Lafayette Rd.

",,40290,,,,,,Sherburne Soil and Water Conservation District,Local/Regional Government,"Sherburne County's Local Water Management Plan identifies eutrophication of lakes (heavy algae blooms) caused by excess phosphorus, loss of aquatic vegation, and loss of riparian vegetation. Removal of natural vegetation near the waters edge in developed and agricultural areas has caused loss of fish and wildlife habitat, increased runoff, and allowed bank erosion. The District will address sources of phosphorus and sediment for three important surface waters in the County. In all, phosphorus will be reduced by 355 pounds and sediment will be reduced by 400 tons per year. 400 feet of eroding streambank on the Rum River will be stabilized with stream barbs. Stream barbs will create structure in the stream which is desirable for fish habitat. Native trees and shrubs will be planted to stabilize soils and provide habitat. The Rum River is regionally important as a State Water Trail and is known for its smallmouth bass fishery. 670 feet of eroding lakeshore on Lake Fremont will be stabilized using innovative bio-engineering methods that will restore native shrubs and grasses on the lakeshore. Lake Fremont is a priority lake for improvement in Sherburne County, known regionally for its northern pike fishery. In older areas of Elk River, stormwater is piped directly to the Mississippi River. Urban runoff carries phosphorus and sediment impairing habitat and recreation. This reach of the Mississippi is designated by the State as a Wild and Scenic River and provides excellent walleye and smallmouth bass fishing. It is also a source of drinking water for the Twin cities. Stormwater treatment will be installed at three sites to infiltrate runoff before it enters the river.

In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1). Projects were selected from a prioritized list using criteria such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support.

If additional matching funds are found, available OHF money will be shifted to fund other projects on our priority list.Department resources for stream habitat work falls far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department and partners such as Trout Unlimited, as well as smaller groups such as lake associations who seek funding through the Conservation Partners Legacy program.

The creek has supported a wild brown trout population since they were introduced into Little Rock Lake in 1908. A population assessment done in 1992, however, failed to document the presence of brown trout suggesting that population may have become critically low during the drought years of the late 1980's and early 1990's. The stream has since been listed as impaired due to the low abundance of trout and other cold water fish. A subsequent study of Little Rock Creek identified low flows, specifically flow originating from groundwater, as the primary stressor to the fish. Little Rock Lake itself is severely degraded with toxic blue green algae levels during some years. In 2007, a severe algae bloom caused officials to advise lake users to avoid contact with the water.

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach.

The Mustinka River was first channelized as a state ditch in 1896 and again as an Army Corps of Engineers project in the early 1950’s. This channelization resulted in a direct conversion of about 43 miles of natural sinuous channel and floodplain corridor to about 25 miles of straightened channel without a functional riparian corridor. The Mustinka River (Judicial Ditch 14) currently provides little functional aquatic or riparian corridor habitat.  This stream corridor project will rehabilitate a 5.5 mile portion and directly provide both fish and wildlife habitat benefits in the prairie region. This stream corridor rehabilitation project will convert 5.5 miles of the upper reaches of the Mustinka River to a more functional 8 to 9 mile long meandering channel within a 300 foot wide, 260 acre floodplain corridor.  The stream rehabilitation will be based on the principles of natural channel design with an understanding of the hydrology and fluvial geomorphology at the site. The enhanced stream and associated riparian wetland habitats will provide seasonal spawning and nursery habitat to a variety of fish species including northern pike and walleye and some of the other 30+ fish species that are found in the Lake Traverse watershed.In addition to the fish habitat directly provided in the 8 to 9 mile stream channel, the associated floodplain grassland and wetland habitat elements in the restored and protected 260 acre river corridor will provide year-round wildlife habitat.  An estimated 90% of Minnesota’s prairie wetlands have been lost due to agricultural drainage and development.

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Minnesota may be the Land of 10,000 lakes, but often overlooked are its over 69,000 miles of streams. From small trout streams to the mighty Mississippi, streams support a wealth of biodiversity and also provide excellent fishing opportunities. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as Southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers can pursue.Minnesota streams host 162 fish species and 48 mussel species, of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. Streams in Minnesota have been degraded through a history of alterations to the streams themselves by channelization (straightening), poor riparian management, and fragmentation by barriers such as dams. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) works to restore or enhance habitat to address these impacts, benefiting fish, mussels, and other aquatic life. However, department resources for stream habitat work fall far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department. In past rounds of OHF, stream habitat has been part of a larger MNDNR package of aquatic habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement projects. In this round we have chosen to create a proposal focused solely on stream restoration and enhancement, with aquatic habitat protection in a separate proposal.One of the biggest limitations to fish and mussel species is the fragmentation of rivers. Dams and other obstructions block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas. The juvenile life stage of mussels spends it's first weeks of life on the gills of a fish, and relies on that fish to transport it upstream to hospitable habitats. Barriers can lead to the loss of fish and mussel species above dams, and reduce populations living below them. Often dams and other barriers are not longer serving their intended function and can be removed. In cases where the dam is still functioning, the structure can be modified to allow fish passage. Examples of modifications include projects that have converted dams into rapids, and construction of nature-like fishways around or over dams.A case study in the benefits of fish passage is the removal of a dam on the Pomme de Terre River in Appleton, MN. Following removal, 10 fish species including walleye and channel catfish have returned to 42 upstream miles of river that became accessible. Mussel species have also benefited, with two native mussel species now found in areas upstream of the dam where formerly they had been absent. Another example is the modification of the Heidberg Dam on the Wild Rice River to allow fish passage, where 10 fish species including walleye, sauger, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass are now found where they had formerly been absent, as far as 75 miles upstream of the dam. These case studies show that although the footprint of fish passage projects is small (typically only a few acres) and the cost per acre appears high, the benefits go far beyond the project site. We can impact miles of stream in a single project, and the benefits will endure.Some proposed fish passage projects target species living in lakes that use streams for spawning. Many species including northern pike, walleye, suckers, and numerous minnow species migrate out of lakes and into streams to spawn before returning to the lake. On many lakes, the outlet has been dammed in order to stabilize water levels for property owners. These dams block fish from returning to the lake when they've finished spawning, as well as blocking their offspring from migrating to the lake when they mature.The potential for fish passage projects to enable access by invasive species has been examined for all proposed projects. None of these projects serve as a barrier between problem species such as Invasive Carp and upstream waters. Most aquatic invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels or Eurasian water milfoil) rely on other vectors such as unintentional transport by recreational boaters, rather than swimming upstream past barriers.Many streams in Minnesota have also been degraded by habitat alteration such as channelization (straightening). This simplifies the habitat and eliminates the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by different life stages of fish. Other streams have issues with bank erosion that degrade habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our package of fish passage and stream channel restoration and enhancement includes 7 projects that occur in 4 of 5 LSOHC planning regions. Although the footprint of projects is 22 acres, the projects will benefit over 4,400 acres of lakes and streams (refer to Table 1) through restoration or enhancement of fish passage. Projects were selected from a prioritized list that includes factors such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. We have chosen to include parcels in this proposal above and beyond what can be accomplished with allocated funds. This will allow flexibility to complete additional projects should new sources of matching funds become available.Several of the projects on our parcel list (e.g. the Adrian Dam, and Cottonwood River dams) will involve partnership with other state agencies or local governments. Partners in many cases are local governments that own a dam proposed for removal or modification. In all cases local partners are supportive of the project, and will contribute in-kind staff time toward the projects' completion. This request also funds an ongoing stream habitat coordinator position and a part-time intern for two years. The increased work of coordinating complex stream projects funded by OHF is greater than can be handled by existing MNDNR staff. These positions create the capacity for MNDNR to effectively complete the proposed projects.",,,,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Brian,Nerbonne,MN DNR,500 Lafayette Rd.

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Streams in Minnesota support a wealth of biodiversity, including 162 fish species and 48 mussel species of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1). Projects were selected from a prioritized list using criteria such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. Two of the projects on our parcel list (Whetstone River and Fish Lake Dam) would involve partners, who will contribute in-kind staff time as well as financial resources toward the projects' completion. Allocated funds will only allow completion of our highest priority project, restoration of Mounds Creek, along with three smaller fish passage projects at Fish Creek, Crane Lake, and Lake Carlos. If additional matching funds are found, available OHF money will be shifted to fund other projects on our priority list.Department resources for stream habitat work falls far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department and partners such as Trout Unlimited, as well as smaller groups such as lake associations who seek funding through the Conservation Partners Legacy program.

In the first phase of this multi-phase project, the Buffalo-Red River Watershed District (BRRWD) in partnership with landowners, federal, state, and local agencies, will put much of the rerouted channel back restoring up to 4.6 miles of the South Branch with up to 100 acres of associated riparian habitat corridor. Additional restorations of straightened stream and river channels along the South Branch and Whisky Creek will be completed as funding permits.","The construction of several legal ditch systems and other channel straightening efforts eliminated hundreds of acres of quality of stream habitat within the BRRWD. In some cases, the channelization simply straightened the stream channel and in others the constructed ditch diverted water away from the natural stream. Straightened channels create homogenous habitats, they no longer have the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by fish at various stages in their life cycle. The straightened reaches also tend to lose access to their floodplains which increases erosion in the channel and causes downstream flooding. In addition, aggradation of the downstream channel due to increased sediment loading reduces habitat quality and makes flooding worse. Over the last several years, the BRRWD, with input and in partnership with landowners, federal, state, and local agencies, designed comprehensive subwatershed restoration plans and intends to implement these plans over the next several years. A component of these plans includes the restoration of numerous reaches of straightened and abandoned creek and river channels throughout the Watershed District. Prioritization of projects is largely based on ecological benefits, being shovel-ready and having landowner and other stakeholder support. In the first phase of this multi-phase project, the BRRWD plans to restore up to 4.6 miles of perennial stream with up to 100 plus acres of associated riparian corridor habitat along the South Branch of the Buffalo River. The project will divert water from Wilkin County Ditch No. 44 (formerly called Judicial Ditch 3) back into the abandoned South Branch channel. The South Branch will be restored using natural channel design principles. The river restoration has been designed with direct input from the MN DNR Stream Habitat Program as well as the MN Board of Water & Soil Resources (BWSR). A sinuous riffle-pool natural channel design is proposed to recreate the aquatic habitat diversity that was lost in the straightened ditch. The naturally stable restored channel will not only recreate lost habitat, but will reduce the current erosion that is overloading downstream reaches of the South Branch. This project is being completed in conjunction with a Reinvest in Minnesota project being implemented by the MN BWSR. As part of their comprehensive subwatershed planning process, the District has completed planning and design on three additional stream reaches which are included as part of this application package. These include the restoration of Whisky Creek, its tributary, and the South Branch of the Buffalo River and their associated riparian corridors. Additional stream restoration enhancement along the South Branch of the Buffalo River and Whisky Creek will be completed as funding permits when and if additional sources of match funding become available. Combined, these comprehensive projects have the potential to restore and enhance more than 38 miles of natural prairie stream.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,46.551385,-96.446857

Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8. Rush Creek (Winona); 9. Mill Creek (Olmsted & Fillmore); 10. Newburg Creek (Fillmore); 11. Willow Creek (Fillmore).; 12. Cedar Valley Creek (Winona); 13. Pickwick Creek (Winona); 14. Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,46.567987,-92.491805

From small trout streams to the mighty Mississippi, streams support a wealth of biodiversity and also provide excellent fishing opportunities. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as Southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers can pursue.Minnesota streams host 162 fish species and 48 mussel species, of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. Streams in Minnesota have been degraded through a history of alterations to the streams themselves by channelization (straightening), poor riparian management, and fragmentation by barriers such as dams. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) works to restore or enhance habitat to address these impacts, benefiting fish, mussels, and other aquatic life. However, department resources for stream habitat work fall far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department. In past rounds of OHF, stream habitat has been part of a larger MNDNR package of aquatic habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement projects. In this round we have chosen to create a proposal focused solely on stream restoration and enhancement, with aquatic habitat protection in a separate proposal.One of the biggest limitations to fish and mussel species is the fragmentation of rivers. Dams and other obstructions block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas. The juvenile life stage of mussels spends it's first weeks of life on the gills of a fish, and relies on that fish to transport it upstream to hospitable habitats. Barriers can lead to the loss of fish and mussel species above dams, and reduce populations living below them. Often dams and other barriers are not longer serving their intended function and can be removed. In cases where the dam is still functioning, the structure can be modified to allow fish passage. Examples of modifications include projects that have converted dams into rapids, and construction of nature-like fishways around or over dams.A case study in the benefits of fish passage is the removal of a dam on the Pomme de Terre River in Appleton, MN. Following removal, 10 fish species including walleye and channel catfish have returned to 42 upstream miles of river that became accessible. Mussel species have also benefited, with two native mussel species now found in areas upstream of the dam where formerly they had been absent. Another example is the modification of the Heidberg Dam on the Wild Rice River to allow fish passage, where 10 fish species including walleye, sauger, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass are now found where they had formerly been absent, as far as 75 miles upstream of the dam. These case studies show that although the footprint of fish passage projects is small (typically only a few acres) and the cost per acre appears high, the benefits go far beyond the project site. We can impact miles of stream in a single project, and the benefits will endure.Some proposed fish passage projects target species living in lakes that use streams for spawning. Many species including northern pike, walleye, suckers, and numerous minnow species migrate out of lakes and into streams to spawn before returning to the lake. On many lakes, the outlet has been dammed in order to stabilize water levels for property owners. These dams block fish from returning to the lake when they've finished spawning, as well as blocking their offspring from migrating to the lake when they mature.The potential for fish passage projects to enable access by invasive species has been examined for all proposed projects. None of these projects serve as a barrier between problem species such as Invasive Carp and upstream waters. Most aquatic invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels or Eurasian water milfoil) rely on other vectors such as unintentional transport by recreational boaters, rather than swimming upstream past barriers.Many streams in Minnesota have also been degraded by habitat alteration such as channelization (straightening). This simplifies the habitat and eliminates the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by different life stages of fish. Other streams have issues with bank erosion that degrade habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our package of fish passage and stream channel restoration and enhancement includes 7 projects that occur in 4 of 5 LSOHC planning regions.

Projects were selected from a prioritized list that includes factors such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. We have chosen to include parcels in this proposal above and beyond what can be accomplished with allocated funds. This will allow flexibility to complete additional projects should new sources of matching funds become available.Several of the projects on our parcel list (e.g. the Adrian Dam, and Cottonwood River dams) will involve partnership with other state agencies or local governments. Partners in many cases are local governments that own a dam proposed for removal or modification. In all cases local partners are supportive of the project, and will contribute in-kind staff time toward the projects' completion. This request also funds an ongoing stream habitat coordinator position and a part-time intern for two years.

Its watershed drains approximately 105 square miles located in Wilkin and western Clay Counties. Wolverton Creek is the outlet for numerous ditch systems and natural drainage in the area and is a significant contributor of sediment to the Red River. The City of Moorhead and other downstream communities obtain drinking water from the Red River. Since 85% of Moorhead's drinking water comes from the Red River, high turbidity results in higher treatment costs for their drinking water system. The Buffalo-Red River Watershed District (BRRWD) along with the Clay and Wilkin SWCDs will reduce erosion and sedimentation in Wolverton Creek by installing side inlets, bufferstrips, and conservation tillage. Significant gully erosion and scour erosion occurs along Wolverton Creek creating the turbidity and sediment problem. The Project will identify lands for bufferstrip establishment and locations for side inlets and grade control for BMP implementation. The project is expected to reduce sediment loadings by 1295 tons/year and phosphorus loadings by 1480 lbs/year. In addition, installation of buffer strips and conservation tillage is expected to significantly reduce sediment and phosphorus loadings. A restoration plan for a segment of Wolverton Creek will be developed with input from the Department of Natural Resources through a separate grant and and integrate additional conservation practices. The teamwork of the BRRWD and the Clay and Wilkin SWCDs has resulted in success in addressing sediment and water erosion issues in the outlet of the Wolverton Creek watershed.

10011407,Pine River Fish Passage Project 2020,2020,1246000,"ML 2019, 1st Sp. Session, Ch. 2, Art. 1, Sec. 2, subd, 5(k)","$1,246,000 the first year is to the commissioner of natural resources for an agreement with the Crow Wing Soil and Water Conservation District to restore and enhance riverine habitat in the Pine River and provide fish passage by removing dams and modifying and installing structures.","Healthy populations of endangered, threatened, and special concern species as well as more common species - Horneyhead chub: species of greatest concern, Least Darter: special concern, Pugnose shiner:threatened have been documented below the dam but not above. These are species sensitive to turbidity, vegetation removal, and eutrophication. The area will be surveyed again by the MPCA in 2022; results will be used to measure project success. .",,,75000,Big Pine Lake Subordinate District Fund,1246000,,,0.6,Crow Wing SWCD,Local/Regional Government,"The future of three state listed fish are at risk in 30 miles of the lower Pine River between Crosslake and the confluence of the Mississippi. IBI scores indicate a dam, in place since 1970, is affecting these populations. The dam blocks them from migrating to essential habitats and has degraded spawning substrate. Results of 2012 MPCA sampling on the river indicate these populations may be absent upstream of the dam. This project will reverse the affects and support fishery goals. It will reopen fish passage to interdependent communities in feeder streams and shallow and deep water habitats. ","Two issues are at hand; one is the threat the rock dam structure has on the health and diversity of aquatic organisms and migratory fish in the Pine River, Big Pine Lake, and upstream waters; and second is the fragile condition of the dam structure. The proposed design solves both issues; reconnect up and downstream communities and remove the dam. A series of five rock riffle structures will be installed in 40 ft intervals along the stream channel at a slope and depth that will effectively restore connectivity and stability. The design is based off a natural channel design method pioneered by Dave Rosgen P.H., Ph.D. and successfully tested on 17 dam replacement projects by DNR Division of Ecological Resources Stream Habitat Program. Based on current research the effects of barriers on aquatic biodiversity and fish distributions up and downstream of dams are clear. A DNR study evaluating 32 barrier dams on mainstem or tributaries of Minnesota rivers showed on average, the number of species declined 41% (MNDNR Barrier Effects on Native Fishes of Minnesota. 2015). Furthermore, intolerant, stream-dependent, imperiled species were the most likely to be absent upstream of barriers. Findings of a 2012 Minnesota Pollution Control survey of the Pine indicated sensitive populations above the dam are declining. Although this reach passed the Fish Index of Biological Integrity, the score was low. Comparatively, the downstream reach scored good and supported a diverse fish community, including greater redhorse a sensitive species, and two rare species, the pugnose shiner a state threatened species, and the least darter, a species of special concern. Pugnose and least darter utilize habitat in slow moving streams and lakes. Habitat loss and degradation are the greatest threats to least darter populations (MNDNR). Big Pine Lake, located upstream of the rock dam is listed as a Biological Significant Lake for Outstanding Plant Community (MNDNR). Reconnecting this downstream stretch with upstream habitat in Big Pine Lake will open up spawning habitat for this species, as well as associated aquatic organisms and fish dependent on diverse aquatic plant communities. The dam is 48 years old and riddled with leaks despite regular maintenance. The design life of a typical dam is 50 years (Powers 2005). Dam failures are often precluded by seepages which increase and eventually cause the dam to fail. The effects would be devastating, drawing down over 400 acres of Big Pine Lake impacting acres of high quality vegetation and aquatic habitat. The low water levels would also affect fisheries, loon nesting, and recreational use of boats, canoes and kayaks. Construction of the five rock riffle structures will add 40,000 sq feet of key spawning habitat for walleye, smallmouth bass, shorthead, greater redhorse, and several minnow species plus restore access to upstream lake and stream habitats.

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Streams in Minnesota support a wealth of biodiversity, including 162 fish species and 48 mussel species of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1). Projects were selected from a prioritized list using criteria such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. Two of the projects on our parcel list (Whetstone River and Fish Lake Dam) would involve partners, who will contribute in-kind staff time as well as financial resources toward the projects' completion. Allocated funds will only allow completion of our highest priority project, restoration of Mounds Creek, along with three smaller fish passage projects at Fish Creek, Crane Lake, and Lake Carlos. If additional matching funds are found, available OHF money will be shifted to fund other projects on our priority list.Department resources for stream habitat work falls far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department and partners such as Trout Unlimited, as well as smaller groups such as lake associations who seek funding through the Conservation Partners Legacy program. We propose to continue funding for two stream habitat specialist positions to enable this increased effort. They provide technical assistance and oversight on Legacy-funded projects by MNDNR and partners, improving efficiency of coordination by providing single points of contact, and enhancing outcomes of stream projects through technical guidance.",,7/1/2017,,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Brian,Nerbonne,MN DNR,500 Lafayette Rd.

The dam is classified as “High” hazard and needs to be modified to provide additional capacity. Replacing the dam with a rock riffle was selected to enhance: fish passage, biological connectivity, riffle habitat, safety, aesthetics, fishing, access, and whitewater boating opportunities. The riffle will include a series of pools and a meandering low flow channel to provide enhanced recreational opportunities along the river for fishing, paddling and other water-based fun.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,46.779073,-92.14099

",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,46.886696,-95.154805

Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,46.887596,-95.159936

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,46.931273,-91.8608

",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water.

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Minnesota may be the Land of 10,000 lakes, but often overlooked are its over 69,000 miles of streams. From small trout streams to the mighty Mississippi, streams support a wealth of biodiversity and also provide excellent fishing opportunities. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as Southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers can pursue.Minnesota streams host 162 fish species and 48 mussel species, of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. Streams in Minnesota have been degraded through a history of alterations to the streams themselves by channelization (straightening), poor riparian management, and fragmentation by barriers such as dams. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) works to restore or enhance habitat to address these impacts, benefiting fish, mussels, and other aquatic life. However, department resources for stream habitat work fall far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department. In past rounds of OHF, stream habitat has been part of a larger MNDNR package of aquatic habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement projects. In this round we have chosen to create a proposal focused solely on stream restoration and enhancement, with aquatic habitat protection in a separate proposal.One of the biggest limitations to fish and mussel species is the fragmentation of rivers. Dams and other obstructions block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas. The juvenile life stage of mussels spends it's first weeks of life on the gills of a fish, and relies on that fish to transport it upstream to hospitable habitats. Barriers can lead to the loss of fish and mussel species above dams, and reduce populations living below them. Often dams and other barriers are not longer serving their intended function and can be removed. In cases where the dam is still functioning, the structure can be modified to allow fish passage. Examples of modifications include projects that have converted dams into rapids, and construction of nature-like fishways around or over dams.A case study in the benefits of fish passage is the removal of a dam on the Pomme de Terre River in Appleton, MN. Following removal, 10 fish species including walleye and channel catfish have returned to 42 upstream miles of river that became accessible. Mussel species have also benefited, with two native mussel species now found in areas upstream of the dam where formerly they had been absent. Another example is the modification of the Heidberg Dam on the Wild Rice River to allow fish passage, where 10 fish species including walleye, sauger, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass are now found where they had formerly been absent, as far as 75 miles upstream of the dam. These case studies show that although the footprint of fish passage projects is small (typically only a few acres) and the cost per acre appears high, the benefits go far beyond the project site. We can impact miles of stream in a single project, and the benefits will endure.Some proposed fish passage projects target species living in lakes that use streams for spawning. Many species including northern pike, walleye, suckers, and numerous minnow species migrate out of lakes and into streams to spawn before returning to the lake. On many lakes, the outlet has been dammed in order to stabilize water levels for property owners. These dams block fish from returning to the lake when they've finished spawning, as well as blocking their offspring from migrating to the lake when they mature.The potential for fish passage projects to enable access by invasive species has been examined for all proposed projects. None of these projects serve as a barrier between problem species such as Invasive Carp and upstream waters. Most aquatic invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels or Eurasian water milfoil) rely on other vectors such as unintentional transport by recreational boaters, rather than swimming upstream past barriers.Many streams in Minnesota have also been degraded by habitat alteration such as channelization (straightening). This simplifies the habitat and eliminates the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by different life stages of fish. Other streams have issues with bank erosion that degrade habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our package of fish passage and stream channel restoration and enhancement includes 7 projects that occur in 4 of 5 LSOHC planning regions. Although the footprint of projects is 22 acres, the projects will benefit over 4,400 acres of lakes and streams (refer to Table 1) through restoration or enhancement of fish passage. Projects were selected from a prioritized list that includes factors such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. We have chosen to include parcels in this proposal above and beyond what can be accomplished with allocated funds. This will allow flexibility to complete additional projects should new sources of matching funds become available.Several of the projects on our parcel list (e.g. the Adrian Dam, and Cottonwood River dams) will involve partnership with other state agencies or local governments. Partners in many cases are local governments that own a dam proposed for removal or modification. In all cases local partners are supportive of the project, and will contribute in-kind staff time toward the projects' completion. This request also funds an ongoing stream habitat coordinator position and a part-time intern for two years. The increased work of coordinating complex stream projects funded by OHF is greater than can be handled by existing MNDNR staff. These positions create the capacity for MNDNR to effectively complete the proposed projects.",,,,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Brian,Nerbonne,MN DNR,500 Lafayette Rd.

However, department resources for stream habitat work fall far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department. In past rounds of OHF, stream habitat has been part of a larger MNDNR package of aquatic habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement projects. In this round we have chosen to create a proposal focused solely on stream restoration and enhancement, with aquatic habitat protection in a separate proposal.One of the biggest limitations to fish and mussel species is the fragmentation of rivers. Dams and other obstructions block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas. The juvenile life stage of mussels spends it's first weeks of life on the gills of a fish, and relies on that fish to transport it upstream to hospitable habitats. Barriers can lead to the loss of fish and mussel species above dams, and reduce populations living below them. Often dams and other barriers are not longer serving their intended function and can be removed. In cases where the dam is still functioning, the structure can be modified to allow fish passage. Examples of modifications include projects that have converted dams into rapids, and construction of nature-like fishways around or over dams.A case study in the benefits of fish passage is the removal of a dam on the Pomme de Terre River in Appleton, MN. Following removal, 10 fish species including walleye and channel catfish have returned to 42 upstream miles of river that became accessible. Mussel species have also benefited, with two native mussel species now found in areas upstream of the dam where formerly they had been absent. Another example is the modification of the Heidberg Dam on the Wild Rice River to allow fish passage, where 10 fish species including walleye, sauger, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass are now found where they had formerly been absent, as far as 75 miles upstream of the dam. These case studies show that although the footprint of fish passage projects is small (typically only a few acres) and the cost per acre appears high, the benefits go far beyond the project site. We can impact miles of stream in a single project, and the benefits will endure.Some proposed fish passage projects target species living in lakes that use streams for spawning. Many species including northern pike, walleye, suckers, and numerous minnow species migrate out of lakes and into streams to spawn before returning to the lake. On many lakes, the outlet has been dammed in order to stabilize water levels for property owners. These dams block fish from returning to the lake when they've finished spawning, as well as blocking their offspring from migrating to the lake when they mature.The potential for fish passage projects to enable access by invasive species has been examined for all proposed projects. None of these projects serve as a barrier between problem species such as Invasive Carp and upstream waters. Most aquatic invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels or Eurasian water milfoil) rely on other vectors such as unintentional transport by recreational boaters, rather than swimming upstream past barriers.Many streams in Minnesota have also been degraded by habitat alteration such as channelization (straightening). This simplifies the habitat and eliminates the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by different life stages of fish. Other streams have issues with bank erosion that degrade habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our package of fish passage and stream channel restoration and enhancement includes 7 projects that occur in 4 of 5 LSOHC planning regions. Although the footprint of projects is 22 acres, the projects will benefit over 4,400 acres of lakes and streams (refer to Table 1) through restoration or enhancement of fish passage. Projects were selected from a prioritized list that includes factors such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. We have chosen to include parcels in this proposal above and beyond what can be accomplished with allocated funds. This will allow flexibility to complete additional projects should new sources of matching funds become available.Several of the projects on our parcel list (e.g. the Adrian Dam, and Cottonwood River dams) will involve partnership with other state agencies or local governments. Partners in many cases are local governments that own a dam proposed for removal or modification. In all cases local partners are supportive of the project, and will contribute in-kind staff time toward the projects' completion. This request also funds an ongoing stream habitat coordinator position and a part-time intern for two years. The increased work of coordinating complex stream projects funded by OHF is greater than can be handled by existing MNDNR staff. These positions create the capacity for MNDNR to effectively complete the proposed projects.",,,,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Brian,Nerbonne,MN DNR,500 Lafayette Rd.

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,46.952114,-91.902602

Landwehr and Director Boggess.  Once LSOHC approved the change, the project came together in just a few weeks.  Permits were obtained, four large rocks were donated at no charge by Cliffs Natural Resources-North Shore Mining and the project begun under the direction of the MNDNR.The best two boulders were chosen and mobilized to the site.  In less than three days the boulders were placed and pinned to the bedrock.  The placed boulders created the needed jumping pool immediately below the falls.  Monitoring has confirmed that fish can now easily pass the former barrier in most flows to gain access to the fertile spawning grounds upstream throughout the entire watershed.We had excellent cooperation from St. Louis County Forestry and the MN DNR.TREE PLANTING:The Lake Superior Steelhead Association (LSSA) has long believed that a healthy watershed includes a healthy and diverse riparian zone.  During the initial walk through under Phase I, a superb planting site was noted in the Main West Branch, with excellent access via the North Shore State Trail.A plan was immediately established for a LSSA ‘volunteer’ plant in the spring of 2013.  The BMP for riparian plantings presently is that of a mix of coniferous and deciduous species to provide a more diverse forest.  The LSSA also wanted to expand the plantings to include species that may become common due to future climate change.  The species to be included in our riparian zone plantings in Phase I included tamarack, white spruce, silver maple, river birch and swamp white oak.  The listed species are all native to Minnesota and were approved by the MN DNR.Following the successful 2013 plant, LSSA members came back in 2014 to plant 150 deciduous trees at the same site.  Also in the spring of 2014, Conservation Corp Minnesota planted hundreds more deciduous trees  in another beaver meadow just downstream from the volunteer site.One major lesson learned was that larger sized trees are needed in order to compete with the invasive reed canary grass found throughout the watershed in old beaver meadows.We had excellent cooperation with both the MN DNR and the St. Louis County Forestry Dept. for our planting work.STREAM ASSESSMENTBefore any rehabilitation project could begin in the watershed, the LSSA realized that information must be gathered that would allow us to prioritize any future rehabilitation efforts.Water temperature was a key so 23 temperature loggers were deployed throughout the watershed.  Loggers were in place from June 1 through September 30 so that the data would coincide with data collected by the MNDNR.  This data determined where juvenile trout could survive and grow, which provided a habitat restoration focal point.The Main West Branch and major unnamed tributaries were assessed for stream conditions, possible connectivity blockages, the state of the riparian cover, condition of stream banks, the location of adult spawning habitat and availability of juvenile holding habitat.  The identified impacts were compiled and overlaid with water temperature data so rehabilitation priorities could be selected based on stream biology.  One fact quickly learned was the significant impact of past and present beaver activity in the watershed.  One unnamed tributary had 29 current or historic dams in just over six miles of stream.  The beaver meadows created by these dams allow for invasive reed canary grass to infiltrate throughout the riparian zone eliminating any regeneration of trees.Through the assessment, the LSSA learned that more spring inflow occurred than originally thought by the MNDNR.  We are now able to predict where trout can live, thrive or parish based on water temperature.BLACK ASHIn the Scope of Work for Phase I of our Knife River Habitat Restoration Grant, identification and possible under plantings in black ash stands were discussed.  The emerald ash borer (EAB) has the potential to wipe out huge tracts of black ash stands through out the United Sates.  According to Laurentian RC& D GIS data, the Main West Branch has over 10 miles of black ash cover in the immediate riparian zone.During the assessment portion of Phase I, field notes and GPS coordinates were taken on black ash stands throughout the Main West Branch.  Technological advances have improved making identification of specific tree species possible by satellite imagery.  LIDAR and color infrared imagery (CIR), when combined, give the height, mass and specific electromagnetic spectrum to plants.  Black ash is rather unique in that it is usually the last to leaf out in the spring and one the earliest to lose its leaves in the fall.  Using our field data and comparing the CIR imagery for the area after black ash had lost their leaves and other deciduous trees maintained their leave cover, we could identify areas that held black ash.Our work was very timely in that the EAB has now been identified in Duluth’s Park Point neighborhood, most recently, in far eastern Duluth.One major item learned from both CIR/LIDAR imagery and verified in the field is that black ash stands are of mixed deciduous species-ash, maple and some yellow birch making under planting less imperative.",7/1/2012,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Kevin,Bovee,Lake Superior Steelhead Association,PO Box 16034,Duluth,MN,55816,(218)

These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream.

Leveraging other funding and efficiently contracting projects allowed us to add habitat projects and adjust to changing conditions.  ",,"Using FY2014 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”), Minnesota Trout Unlimited (MNTU) completed sixteen projects enhancing fish habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Spruce Creek (Cook); 2. Split Rock River (Lake); 3. Miller Creek (St. Louis); 4. Coffee Creek (St. Louis); 5. Garvin Brook (Winona); 6. Trout Brook (Dakota); 7. Blackhoof River (Carlton); 8. Rush Creek (Winona); 9. Mill Creek (Olmsted & Fillmore); 10. Newburg Creek (Fillmore); 11. Willow Creek (Fillmore).; 12. Cedar Valley Creek (Winona); 13. Pickwick Creek (Winona); 14. Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,46.989834,-91.918184

We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path.

We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach.

The major recommendations were to address peak flows (fast water running through the stream channel during and after rain storms or snow melt) and eroding clay streambanks contributing sediment to the river. Through this grant, the South St. Louis Soil & Water Conservation District is working with partners to implement strategies that will help restore the water quality of the Knife and get it off the impaired waters list. Over the past year, the district has been meeting with many people to identify locations for projects to reduce peak flows in the river by tree planting, ditch checks, and other stormwater management practices. It takes time and repeated visits with landowners concerned about their river but the district has completed the following as of January 2011: 1) Identified and secured permission from landowners to plant 7,500 feet of white pine and tamarack along the river. Conifers serve the river both in life and death. In life, they provide shade to the stream (trout require cooler waters to survive) and when they die, they fall into the river creating snags which provide excellent trout habitat and also serve as speed bumps for slowing down water, 2) Secured cooperation with County officials to install 30 ditch checks in appropriate low-gradient ditches to help hold back water, and 3) Cooperated with a neighboring SWCD and two private landowners to stabilize an eroding bank that is contributing sediment to the river.

We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,47.03461,-91.834979

Riparian plantings also occurred in this area. Riparian restoration was achieved in the West Branch tributary of the Knife River through several volunteer plantings and multiple large-scale Conservation Corps Minnesota plantings. ",,"The goal of PH II-Knife River Habitat Rehabilitation project was to improve instream habitat, stabilize slumping streambanks and restore the riparian tree canopy. Site Selection: The Lake Superior Steelhead Association (LSSA) conducted a rapid stream survey to determine the Knife River’s overall condition.  As stream impacts were identified during the survey, impaired stream reaches were photographed and mapped using a GPS unit.  The LSSA also monitored water temperatures to determine where trout survival is the highest.  Finally, biological data was collected to determine the quality of in-stream trout habitat.  This data was combined to rank and prioritize restoration areas where the worst stream impacts are restored, that reside in coolest water zones, within the best habitat corridors.  This data concluded that “first-priority reaches” were located in the upper main Knife River.  This also achieves our goal of a top-down restoration approach  Riparian planting sites were determined by site accessibility and stream assessment using procedures listed above.  Specified project riparian species were determined by the existing riparian habitat, upland or wetland conditions and exposure to sunlight. Restoration Techniques: Natural Channel Design (NCD) utilizes a science-based process to bring an unstable eroding stream reach back to a stable state.  This method surveys an impacted stream reach to collect data to compare it to several stable stream sections.  All survey work is performed using a geomorphic trained Stream Specialist.  The assessment data that is collected includes: stream width to depth ratios, floodplain elevation, erosion calculations, longitudinal profile, cross-section elevation and vegetation cover.  This assessment data is entered into a computer program called Geomorph to create plans and specifications that will redesign the impacted Knife River channel profile, dimensions and shape to mimic stable reaches within the Knife River Watershed. These plans create the basis for the construction project by depicting channel reconfiguration, placement of structures, location of streambed excavation, location and elevation of the floodplain and realignment of the channel.       The LSSA’s NCD process also features a top/down restoration approach.  This approach extends the habitat corridor downstream in three ways: •    Downstream habitats are protected because the upstream sediment load is reduced.   By stabilizing these upstream eroding banks, hundreds of tons of sediment will no longer discharge into the stream channel each year.  This discharged material will no longer fill pools and runs that are critical to rearing trout. •    Instream trout spawning success is more productive.  When trout spawn they discharge their eggs into the gravel.  When sediment discharges during high spring flood events, these eggs or newly hatched trout become covered by settling silts and suffocate larval trout.  By stabilizing these upstream banks sediment discharge is greatly reduced, which generally aids trout production. •    Newly constructed stream channels are reconnected to the floodplain.  These restoration projects reconnect the stream channel to the floodplains, which allows floodwaters to crest the bank and dissipate the current’s energy.  Floodwaters also become trapped and stored in associated floodplain wetlands.  This results in a lower velocity of floodwater and less volume of floodwater that discharges downstream.  This reduction of floodwater velocity and volume minimizes downstream erosion and habitat degradation.  Riparian Zone Planting Projects: •    The species of trees/shrubs being incorporated into the planting plan depends on the area to be planted.  Rehabilitating an abandoned beaver meadow will require species that can tolerate rather damp conditions and even periods of flooding.  The planting of higher elevations, which are not as wet and experience less flooding events, will utilize a wider array of species. •    Wet area species include: white spruce, tamarack, swamp white oak, river birch, silver maple and speckled alder. •    Higher elevation/dryer area species include: red pine, white pine, red maple, silver maple, bur oak, red oak, northern mountain ash and speckled alder. •    Shrubs/Pollinator Species That Are Utilized: viburnum, red twig dogwood, black chokeberry, snowberry, downy arrow-wood, sand bar willow. •    Several species listed above can be utilized in multiple planting locations. •    The LSSA uses locally procured stock for all of our plantings. Scope of Work: •    In stream Habitat Work Area: For PH II of the Knife River Habitat Rehabilitation Project, we restored approximately 2200 linear feet of stream on the main Knife River using the NCD processes.  Included in the area was the rehabilitation of largest slumping clay bank above Lake County Hwy 11.  This bank alone deposited tons of sediment downstream annually. •    Riparian Zone Work Area: We performed planting projects on the main stem of the Knife River and tributaries-the Main West Branch and Stanley Creek.  We planted both low areas and higher ground areas using the species mentioned above. Project Successes: •    In stream Habitat Work: Immediately following construction (and even during the project construction) trout were seen utilizing this stretch of river, ranging from young of the year to spawning adult ages.  Sediment being transported and deposited downstream or even out in Lake Superior has been lessened with the project. •    Riparian Zone Work: We planted many hundreds of trees in PH II creating a diverse riparian zone for years to come. Unique Aspects of the Project: •    Instream Habitat Work: One unique feature of our project is that we contracted with area loggers to bring in toe wood for areas where designated on the design plans.  Some groups prefer to take as much of the needed supplies from the work zone (toe wood, rocks, etc) but this increases the impact on the environment.  The LSSA tries to be as minimally intrusive on the stream and the riparian zone as possible in the project area.  All material that has to be removed for the project is 100% reincorporated back to the project area. •    Riparian Zone Work: The LSSA tried carrying in tree plugs to very remote areas in five gallon buckets.  We found that you could carry almost 50 plugs in one bucket to far removed planting sites much easier than individually potted trees.  This process worked best on areas that had recent beaver activity but the beaver had moved on and the dams had been breached.

Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,47.056186,-91.646518

For more project information, please visit our website: www.steelheaders.org/projects.","Problem Addressed: The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) performed a water quality study from 1986-1996 on the Knife River. This water quality study determined that the Knife River exceeded the TMDL for turbidity. The MPCA conducted a follow-up study in 2008 to determine the sources of this turbidity. This study determined that the sources of the TMDL turbidity exceedance was primarily due to erosion from streambanks and stream bluffs. The LSSA assessed these identified erosion areas in the watershed (see illustration) to determine if the habitat remained suitable for trout. The LSSA found that summertime streamflow and water temperatures were sufficient for trout growth, but instream habitat was degraded from sediment deposition. The LSSA and DNR have concluded that adult trout spawning and juvenile trout rearing habitat could be significantly improved by rehabilitating this stream reach. This project will provide an added secondary benefit to water quality by reducing sediment discharge. By stabilizing these banks this project will be contributing to reducing the Knife River's elevated Turbidity levels. Scope of Work: ?Restore the stream channel's shape, dimension and profile. ?Enhance instream trout habitat strategically positioning large woody debris, rock vanes and ?J? hooks into the channel. ?Restore large woody debris back into the watershed. ?Create new floodplains wetlands. ?Remove flood debris/sediment from floodplain wetlands. ?Reconnect the river channel to the floodplain. ?Raise the groundwater table. ?Stabilize streambanks. ?Rehabilitate the riparian overhead tree canopy. ?Monitor water temperature and stream assessment. How Priorities Were Set: The MPCA identified erosion areas within the Knife River Watershed and determined sections of Reach 4 contributed to the overall TMDL exceedance for Turbidity. The LSSA also conducted a series of stream assessments to identify adequate streamflow and cool water temperatures to support trout growth. Biological data was collected to determine the quality of in-stream trout habitat. This data was combined and ranked to prioritize restoration areas that provide the best benefit to aquatic life and water quality in the Knife River Watershed. Another major consideration in the prioritization of this stream reach is its upstream location. Our restoration goal is to utilize a top-down approach, so major upstream erosion does not re-impact the restoration project and floodwaters can be retained to minimize existing downstream impacts. So, this top/down approach not only rehabilitates a degraded upstream reach but also minimizes downstream impacts. Urgency and Opportunity of the Project: The upper section of Reach 4 is scheduled for construction during the summer of 2019 and the middle section of Reach 4 was awarded last year (2108) and construction is anticipated to begin the fall of 2019. This Lower Reach 4 project will restore the remaining 4,000+ linear feet of Reach 4. If this project is funded, construction will begin in the fall of 2020.

Since the late 1970’s, the Knife River steelhead population has seen a dramatic decrease. One of the reasons for this decline is long-term habitat loss resulting from historic logging. The pre-settlement forest composition within the Knife River watershed consisted primarily of old growth trees. The removal of large trees from the riparian zone destabilized streambanks. The slumping streambanks have also resulted in a high rate of erosion causing a TMDL exceedance for turbidity in the Knife River. Recognizing the threat, the DNR started performing limited stream studies. These studies have determined that habitat degradation in the watershed has resulted in poor rearing conditions for juvenile trout.SCOPE OF WORK*Draft project RFP; put RFP out for bid per approved vendor list; award RFP. All according to MN DNR policies.*Monitor water temperature.* Enhance and restore in-stream habitat by placing large woody debris, rock vanes and “J” hooks into the channel.STREAM STABILIZATIONThe stream will be stabilized by realigning the stream bed to proper bounds by utilizing the data obtained in the initial assessment phase of the project. Also, an opportunity may exist for utilizing off channel wetlands which will enhance the riparian zone habitat. This opportunity will also be determined by the initial assessment data obtained.RIPARIAN ZONE RESTORATONThe riparian zone will be restored via plantings of native pollinator shrubs and native deciduous and coniferous tree species. Riparian zone plantings can occur on the Main Knife River and its major tributaries. After planting the rehabilitation project construction sites, emphasis will be given to replanting the riparian zone in upper river stretches that lack any riparian cover presently.URGENCY AND OPPORTUNITY OF THE PROJECTThe upper section of Reach 4 was funded in 2018 (Phase III).

We enhanced shoreline habitat on 524 acres of riparian land, and instream habitat on 3.1 miles of trout streams and 0.5 miles of warmwater rivers. ",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,47.07235,-91.711145

We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",7/20/2011,6/30/2016,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,,47.077711,-91.712566

This project will restore five severely eroding streambank sites along a 1.5 mile reach of the Stewart River. Commitments have been secured from the five property owners, including the Lake County Highway Department, to complete the project. Overall, these five projects will restore and stabilize the natural channel morphology and will contribute to stable stream channel conditions. The benefits include reduced sediment downstream, less sediment pollution into Lake Superior and protection of native riparian plant communities.

These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,47.131096,-91.705715

",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream.

Trout Run Creek (Winona). These projects were completed used methods similar to those used on projects completed by MNTU chapters in the past several years and also incorporated new research to improve project designs and fish and wildlife benefits.    The specific methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Methods were tailored accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR).  Purposes:  Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes:  (a) increase or maintain adult trout abundance; (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",7/1/2013,3/3/2020,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,Minnesota Trout Unlimited,P O Box 845 ,Chanhassen,MN,55317,(612) 670-1629,jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,,47.244206,-91.481515

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Streams in Minnesota support a wealth of biodiversity, including 162 fish species and 48 mussel species of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1). Projects were selected from a prioritized list using criteria such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. Two of the projects on our parcel list (Whetstone River and Fish Lake Dam) would involve partners, who will contribute in-kind staff time as well as financial resources toward the projects' completion. Allocated funds will only allow completion of our highest priority project, restoration of Mounds Creek, along with three smaller fish passage projects at Fish Creek, Crane Lake, and Lake Carlos. If additional matching funds are found, available OHF money will be shifted to fund other projects on our priority list.Department resources for stream habitat work falls far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department and partners such as Trout Unlimited, as well as smaller groups such as lake associations who seek funding through the Conservation Partners Legacy program. We propose to continue funding for two stream habitat specialist positions to enable this increased effort.

These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream.

One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach.

Treatment of this water for drinking is a major expense to the City. Reducing pollutants will be a benefit to those costs and the residents of Thief River Falls. The site was surveyed the summer of 2010. The Red River Valley Conservation Service Area is currently working on the project design and construction is scheduled to begin the summer of 2011.

Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks.

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Minnesota may be the Land of 10,000 lakes, but often overlooked are its over 69,000 miles of streams. From small trout streams to the mighty Mississippi, streams support a wealth of biodiversity and also provide excellent fishing opportunities. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as Southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers can pursue.Minnesota streams host 162 fish species and 48 mussel species, of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. Streams in Minnesota have been degraded through a history of alterations to the streams themselves by channelization (straightening), poor riparian management, and fragmentation by barriers such as dams. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) works to restore or enhance habitat to address these impacts, benefiting fish, mussels, and other aquatic life. However, department resources for stream habitat work fall far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department. In past rounds of OHF, stream habitat has been part of a larger MNDNR package of aquatic habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement projects. In this round we have chosen to create a proposal focused solely on stream restoration and enhancement, with aquatic habitat protection in a separate proposal.One of the biggest limitations to fish and mussel species is the fragmentation of rivers. Dams and other obstructions block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas. The juvenile life stage of mussels spends it's first weeks of life on the gills of a fish, and relies on that fish to transport it upstream to hospitable habitats. Barriers can lead to the loss of fish and mussel species above dams, and reduce populations living below them. Often dams and other barriers are not longer serving their intended function and can be removed. In cases where the dam is still functioning, the structure can be modified to allow fish passage. Examples of modifications include projects that have converted dams into rapids, and construction of nature-like fishways around or over dams.A case study in the benefits of fish passage is the removal of a dam on the Pomme de Terre River in Appleton, MN. Following removal, 10 fish species including walleye and channel catfish have returned to 42 upstream miles of river that became accessible. Mussel species have also benefited, with two native mussel species now found in areas upstream of the dam where formerly they had been absent. Another example is the modification of the Heidberg Dam on the Wild Rice River to allow fish passage, where 10 fish species including walleye, sauger, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass are now found where they had formerly been absent, as far as 75 miles upstream of the dam. These case studies show that although the footprint of fish passage projects is small (typically only a few acres) and the cost per acre appears high, the benefits go far beyond the project site. We can impact miles of stream in a single project, and the benefits will endure.Some proposed fish passage projects target species living in lakes that use streams for spawning. Many species including northern pike, walleye, suckers, and numerous minnow species migrate out of lakes and into streams to spawn before returning to the lake. On many lakes, the outlet has been dammed in order to stabilize water levels for property owners. These dams block fish from returning to the lake when they've finished spawning, as well as blocking their offspring from migrating to the lake when they mature.The potential for fish passage projects to enable access by invasive species has been examined for all proposed projects. None of these projects serve as a barrier between problem species such as Invasive Carp and upstream waters. Most aquatic invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels or Eurasian water milfoil) rely on other vectors such as unintentional transport by recreational boaters, rather than swimming upstream past barriers.Many streams in Minnesota have also been degraded by habitat alteration such as channelization (straightening). This simplifies the habitat and eliminates the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by different life stages of fish. Other streams have issues with bank erosion that degrade habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our package of fish passage and stream channel restoration and enhancement includes 7 projects that occur in 4 of 5 LSOHC planning regions. Although the footprint of projects is 22 acres, the projects will benefit over 4,400 acres of lakes and streams (refer to Table 1) through restoration or enhancement of fish passage. Projects were selected from a prioritized list that includes factors such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. We have chosen to include parcels in this proposal above and beyond what can be accomplished with allocated funds. This will allow flexibility to complete additional projects should new sources of matching funds become available.Several of the projects on our parcel list (e.g. the Adrian Dam, and Cottonwood River dams) will involve partnership with other state agencies or local governments. Partners in many cases are local governments that own a dam proposed for removal or modification. In all cases local partners are supportive of the project, and will contribute in-kind staff time toward the projects' completion. This request also funds an ongoing stream habitat coordinator position and a part-time intern for two years. The increased work of coordinating complex stream projects funded by OHF is greater than can be handled by existing MNDNR staff. These positions create the capacity for MNDNR to effectively complete the proposed projects.",,,,Outdoor Heritage Fund,In Progress,,,Brian,Nerbonne,MN DNR,500 Lafayette Rd.

The existing 11-foot high dam will be modified with a rock-arch rapids fishway that will provide lake sturgeon and walleye spawning habitat and reconnect more than 30 miles and in excess of 300 acres of high quality, diverse habitat along the South Branch. In addition to the fish habitat improvement, the project will provide enhanced recreational opportunities for paddlers along the river. ","Many native fish species migrate from the Red River to tributary streams, such as Two Rivers, to access quality spawning habitats. This is especially true for Lake Sturgeon, a native species recently re-introduced into the Red River Basin, which make very long migrations to reproduce in riffles and rapids found in high gradient areas. Barriers to fish passage, such as dams, prevent fish from making this seasonal spawning run. Much work has been done to eliminate these barriers but additional work is required. Restoring connections from the Red River to these critical habitats helps to re-establish and maintain healthy, robust native fish communities with greater resiliency to invasion by exotic species. Fisheries surveys on Two Rivers clearly identified the Hallock Dam as a barrier to upstream migration. Recent fish surveys conducted by the DNR have found that 13 of the 43 species present in the Two Rivers are absent upstream of the dam in Hallock. Absent are large river species such as Channel Catfish, Sauger, and Freshwater Drum. The absence of these fish species also impact mussel populations which rely on the upstream migrations of large river species to transport juvenile life stages to hospitable habitat. Based on several DNR studies, removal of barriers create more diverse mussel and fish communities and also expand and improve fishing opportunities in river segments above barriers.A fish passage project similar to the one proposed for Two Rivers was conducted on the Wild Rice River, another major tributary to the Red River. Similar to findings on Two Rivers, large river fish species such as Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, Goldeye, Sauger, and Smallmouth Bass were common below but rarely captured above the dam. Within one year of passage restoration at this dam, these large river species were common upstream of the dam, with channel catfish captured 70 river miles above the previous barrier. Restoration of fish passage on Two Rivers would likely yield similar results.Retrofit of the Hallock dam with a rock arch rapids fishway will allow fish migration upstream of the Dam into a 30 plus mile stretch of river and more than 300 acres of aquatic habitat between Hallock and the Lake Bronson Dam. The river channel upstream of the reservoir created by the Hallock Dam between Lake Bronson and Hallock is a segment of river that is in its most natural, unaltered state. The channel undergoes a series of riffles and pools, and provides excellent fish and wildlife habitat.Downstream of the dam, an unstable stream channel has caused degraded habitat and eroding banks. Here, as funding allows, the channel enhancement work will recreate the appropriate complex and diverse pool-riffle habitat. This will benefit both the project area and the habitat reaches downstream that will no longer need to handle the excessive sediment load.

The Roseau River Watershed District and Minnesota DNR, through multiple phases, will cooperatively restore a total of 13.6 miles of river channel, adding 366 acres of high-quality large river habitat within the Roseau River WMA and enhancing the river's riparian habitat corridor. This project is the first phase and will begin progress towards restoring the Roseau River.","The Roseau River is currently classified as Minnesota State Ditch 51 starting at the Canadian border and continuing 45 miles upstream to County Road 28. This reach of the river was channelized in the early 1900s causing habitat degradation of the river and its riparian corridor. The increased slope of the river has led to entrenchment, disconnected oxbows, high bank erosion, reduced access to floodplain and loss of critical habitat. Altered hydrology affects turbidity and water temperature leading to reduced biodiversity and vulnerability to climate change. The Roseau River Watershed District (RRWD) and Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) are leading implementation of a plan to restore this reach of the Roseau River. The project will restore degraded habitat, increase the resilience of the ecosystem surrounding the river, reestablish natural levels of connectivity between the river and its floodplain, strengthen biodiversity, and restore overall watershed hydrology to the area. When all phases are completed, the project reconnects 13.6 miles of the Roseau River for a total restoration of 22.5 miles of river, floodplain and associated riparian habitat located almost entirely within the Roseau River Wildlife Management Area (RRWMA). Estimated restoration length for Phase 1 is approximately 5 miles. Restoration will include rehabilitation of natural river habitat, and enhancement of wetland and prairie plant communities in both form and function. The river restoration will be based on the principles of natural channel design with an understanding of the hydrology and fluvial geomorphology at the site. The restored river and associated riparian wetlands and prairie will improve habitat for several species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) such as Black sandshell, Yellow rail and Nelson's sparrow, as well as game fish such as Lake sturgeon, walleye, Northern pike and Channel catfish. The restoration is located within the MN DNR's Aspen Parklands Conservation Focus Area (CFA) identified in the Minnesota Wildlife Action Plan 2015 ? 2025 (WAP) as well as the Kittson-Roseau Aspen Parkland Prairie Core Area identified in the Minnesota Prairie Conservation Plan. The Roseau River and its riparian corridor is considered a key habitat for SGCN and received a high score (high priority for restoration) in the Wildlife Action Network. Almost all of the land required for restoration is already part of the RRWMA, eliminating the need for major land acquisition and bypassing one of the most difficult steps in conservation projects. Outdoor recreation within the WMA already includes hunting, fishing and birding. The MN DNR constructed three large waterfowl pools located approximately 1 mile north of the project area. These pools are a rich source of wildlife habitat and are part of the Pine to Prairie Birding Trail. Outdoor recreation will benefit from the restoration by expanding opportunities to enjoy wildlife through improved kayaking and canoeing along the river as well as other activities compatible with the WMA's conservation mission. The restored river would be an excellent candidate for the MN Water Trail.

These projects were modifications to dams that will allow fish to bypass these former barriers. One fish passage project on Chester Creek planned for this appropriation was not completed due to delays in contracting for construction by our project partner, the city of Duluth. They have been very busy contracting stream projects due to the flood of 2012, and this unexpected development kept us from completing the project on time. A design for the project was paid for with this appropriation. The project will be built in 2016 using flood damage money from the State of Minnesota.An instream habitat project was completed on West Beaver Creek. The project narrowed the stream channel to improve instream habitat and better transport fine sediment. Instream habitat was also enhanced, and bank stability improved to reduce erosion.Riparian habitat was enhanced at fourteen coldwater streams and two warmwater streams. These projects will enhance native prairie plants that will improve bank stability and instream cover. Prairie species also encourage narrow and deep stream channels that better move fine sediment, improving habitat for fish and invertebrates. Habitat practices included brush removal, prescribed burns, control of invasive plants, and planting of native species.Lake riparian habitat was enhanced at nine locations. These projects were done cooperatively through grants to local organizations. Mowed turf grass was replaced with native plants with deep roots that are better at stabilizing the shoreline and provide habitat for species such as frogs and other aquatic animals. These parcels are also open to public fishing.We permanently protected lakeshore habitat at eight locations, covering 276 acres. These parcels will protect intact lake shoreline that has been shown to be critical to fish reproduction, and to preventing shoreland erosion. We also protected one parcel on a trout stream through a conservation easement. This will protect coldwater conditions and habitat in the stream through the preservation of riparian vegetation. This parcel will also be open to public fishing.We fell short of our planned output acreage for this appropriation due to a number of factors. First, our protection acreage can vary depending on the relative amount of upland land that is purchased with adjoining waterfront. Sometimes parcels are a narrow strip of lakeshore, while at other times a parcel may be quite deep and have considerable upland that is purchased. For this appropriation, our acquisitions leaned toward primarily waterfront land resulting in a shortfall of 98 acres. Second, when this accomplishment plan was written we planned to be able to account for benefitted upstream acres for fish passage projects. During a plan amendment for a different appropriation we were given direction by the council that we should only count footprint acres for these types of projects. We did not go back and do plan amendments for other appropriations to reflect this guidance, but did follow that direction in our reporting. As a result we reported 1260 acres less than was planned. Third, our trout stream riparian enhancement work over-estimated the amount that we could complete, resulting in a shortfall of 424 acres. The work for this part of the appropriation was completed during the last 6 months that the money was available, preventing a plan amendment to reflect the change in acreage output. We will know better in the future how to estimate acres for this type of work. The fourth reason for our shortfall was an amendment from a fish passage project on the Mississippi River at Little Falls to a channel restoration project on the Buffalo River. As previously mentioned, when the plan was written we expected to report the full benefitted acreage for the fish passage project. When we amended to plan to spend that money on the Buffalo River, there was no corresponding change to our planned output acres as reflected in table 1. This was not changed mainly because the original version of ML2010 accomplishment plan does not include a “Table 1” as shown in the online version. Instead there are a series of less organized tables that allow for a more narrative description of the work.

Habitat practices included brush removal, prescribed burns, control of invasive plants, and planting of native species.Lake riparian habitat was enhanced at nine locations. These projects were done cooperatively through grants to local organizations. Mowed turf grass was replaced with native plants with deep roots that are better at stabilizing the shoreline and provide habitat for species such as frogs and other aquatic animals.

We also protected one parcel on a trout stream through a conservation easement. This will protect coldwater conditions and habitat in the stream through the preservation of riparian vegetation.

First, our protection acreage can vary depending on the relative amount of upland land that is purchased with adjoining waterfront. Sometimes parcels are a narrow strip of lakeshore, while at other times a parcel may be quite deep and have considerable upland that is purchased. For this appropriation, our acquisitions leaned toward primarily waterfront land resulting in a shortfall of 98 acres. Second, when this accomplishment plan was written we planned to be able to account for benefitted upstream acres for fish passage projects. During a plan amendment for a different appropriation we were given direction by the council that we should only count footprint acres for these types of projects. We did not go back and do plan amendments for other appropriations to reflect this guidance, but did follow that direction in our reporting. As a result we reported 1260 acres less than was planned. Third, our trout stream riparian enhancement work over-estimated the amount that we could complete, resulting in a shortfall of 424 acres. The work for this part of the appropriation was completed during the last 6 months that the money was available, preventing a plan amendment to reflect the change in acreage output.

As previously mentioned, when the plan was written we expected to report the full benefitted acreage for the fish passage project. When we amended to plan to spend that money on the Buffalo River, there was no corresponding change to our planned output acres as reflected in table 1.

They have been very busy contracting stream projects due to the flood of 2012, and this unexpected development kept us from completing the project on time. A design for the project was paid for with this appropriation. The project will be built in 2016 using flood damage money from the State of Minnesota.An instream habitat project was completed on West Beaver Creek. The project narrowed the stream channel to improve instream habitat and better transport fine sediment. Instream habitat was also enhanced, and bank stability improved to reduce erosion.Riparian habitat was enhanced at fourteen coldwater streams and two warmwater streams. These projects will enhance native prairie plants that will improve bank stability and instream cover. Prairie species also encourage narrow and deep stream channels that better move fine sediment, improving habitat for fish and invertebrates. Habitat practices included brush removal, prescribed burns, control of invasive plants, and planting of native species.Lake riparian habitat was enhanced at nine locations. These projects were done cooperatively through grants to local organizations. Mowed turf grass was replaced with native plants with deep roots that are better at stabilizing the shoreline and provide habitat for species such as frogs and other aquatic animals. These parcels are also open to public fishing.We permanently protected lakeshore habitat at eight locations, covering 276 acres. These parcels will protect intact lake shoreline that has been shown to be critical to fish reproduction, and to preventing shoreland erosion. We also protected one parcel on a trout stream through a conservation easement. This will protect coldwater conditions and habitat in the stream through the preservation of riparian vegetation. This parcel will also be open to public fishing.We fell short of our planned output acreage for this appropriation due to a number of factors. First, our protection acreage can vary depending on the relative amount of upland land that is purchased with adjoining waterfront. Sometimes parcels are a narrow strip of lakeshore, while at other times a parcel may be quite deep and have considerable upland that is purchased. For this appropriation, our acquisitions leaned toward primarily waterfront land resulting in a shortfall of 98 acres. Second, when this accomplishment plan was written we planned to be able to account for benefitted upstream acres for fish passage projects. During a plan amendment for a different appropriation we were given direction by the council that we should only count footprint acres for these types of projects. We did not go back and do plan amendments for other appropriations to reflect this guidance, but did follow that direction in our reporting. As a result we reported 1260 acres less than was planned. Third, our trout stream riparian enhancement work over-estimated the amount that we could complete, resulting in a shortfall of 424 acres. The work for this part of the appropriation was completed during the last 6 months that the money was available, preventing a plan amendment to reflect the change in acreage output. We will know better in the future how to estimate acres for this type of work. The fourth reason for our shortfall was an amendment from a fish passage project on the Mississippi River at Little Falls to a channel restoration project on the Buffalo River. As previously mentioned, when the plan was written we expected to report the full benefitted acreage for the fish passage project. When we amended to plan to spend that money on the Buffalo River, there was no corresponding change to our planned output acres as reflected in table 1. This was not changed mainly because the original version of ML2010 accomplishment plan does not include a “Table 1” as shown in the online version.

They have been very busy contracting stream projects due to the flood of 2012, and this unexpected development kept us from completing the project on time. A design for the project was paid for with this appropriation. The project will be built in 2016 using flood damage money from the State of Minnesota.An instream habitat project was completed on West Beaver Creek. The project narrowed the stream channel to improve instream habitat and better transport fine sediment. Instream habitat was also enhanced, and bank stability improved to reduce erosion.Riparian habitat was enhanced at fourteen coldwater streams and two warmwater streams. These projects will enhance native prairie plants that will improve bank stability and instream cover. Prairie species also encourage narrow and deep stream channels that better move fine sediment, improving habitat for fish and invertebrates. Habitat practices included brush removal, prescribed burns, control of invasive plants, and planting of native species.Lake riparian habitat was enhanced at nine locations. These projects were done cooperatively through grants to local organizations. Mowed turf grass was replaced with native plants with deep roots that are better at stabilizing the shoreline and provide habitat for species such as frogs and other aquatic animals. These parcels are also open to public fishing.We permanently protected lakeshore habitat at eight locations, covering 276 acres. These parcels will protect intact lake shoreline that has been shown to be critical to fish reproduction, and to preventing shoreland erosion. We also protected one parcel on a trout stream through a conservation easement. This will protect coldwater conditions and habitat in the stream through the preservation of riparian vegetation. This parcel will also be open to public fishing.We fell short of our planned output acreage for this appropriation due to a number of factors. First, our protection acreage can vary depending on the relative amount of upland land that is purchased with adjoining waterfront. Sometimes parcels are a narrow strip of lakeshore, while at other times a parcel may be quite deep and have considerable upland that is purchased. For this appropriation, our acquisitions leaned toward primarily waterfront land resulting in a shortfall of 98 acres. Second, when this accomplishment plan was written we planned to be able to account for benefitted upstream acres for fish passage projects. During a plan amendment for a different appropriation we were given direction by the council that we should only count footprint acres for these types of projects. We did not go back and do plan amendments for other appropriations to reflect this guidance, but did follow that direction in our reporting. As a result we reported 1260 acres less than was planned. Third, our trout stream riparian enhancement work over-estimated the amount that we could complete, resulting in a shortfall of 424 acres. The work for this part of the appropriation was completed during the last 6 months that the money was available, preventing a plan amendment to reflect the change in acreage output. We will know better in the future how to estimate acres for this type of work. The fourth reason for our shortfall was an amendment from a fish passage project on the Mississippi River at Little Falls to a channel restoration project on the Buffalo River. As previously mentioned, when the plan was written we expected to report the full benefitted acreage for the fish passage project. When we amended to plan to spend that money on the Buffalo River, there was no corresponding change to our planned output acres as reflected in table 1. This was not changed mainly because the original version of ML2010 accomplishment plan does not include a “Table 1” as shown in the online version.

A design for the project was paid for with this appropriation. The project will be built in 2016 using flood damage money from the State of Minnesota.An instream habitat project was completed on West Beaver Creek. The project narrowed the stream channel to improve instream habitat and better transport fine sediment. Instream habitat was also enhanced, and bank stability improved to reduce erosion.Riparian habitat was enhanced at fourteen coldwater streams and two warmwater streams. These projects will enhance native prairie plants that will improve bank stability and instream cover. Prairie species also encourage narrow and deep stream channels that better move fine sediment, improving habitat for fish and invertebrates. Habitat practices included brush removal, prescribed burns, control of invasive plants, and planting of native species.Lake riparian habitat was enhanced at nine locations. These projects were done cooperatively through grants to local organizations. Mowed turf grass was replaced with native plants with deep roots that are better at stabilizing the shoreline and provide habitat for species such as frogs and other aquatic animals. These parcels are also open to public fishing.We permanently protected lakeshore habitat at eight locations, covering 276 acres. These parcels will protect intact lake shoreline that has been shown to be critical to fish reproduction, and to preventing shoreland erosion. We also protected one parcel on a trout stream through a conservation easement. This will protect coldwater conditions and habitat in the stream through the preservation of riparian vegetation. This parcel will also be open to public fishing.We fell short of our planned output acreage for this appropriation due to a number of factors. First, our protection acreage can vary depending on the relative amount of upland land that is purchased with adjoining waterfront. Sometimes parcels are a narrow strip of lakeshore, while at other times a parcel may be quite deep and have considerable upland that is purchased. For this appropriation, our acquisitions leaned toward primarily waterfront land resulting in a shortfall of 98 acres. Second, when this accomplishment plan was written we planned to be able to account for benefitted upstream acres for fish passage projects. During a plan amendment for a different appropriation we were given direction by the council that we should only count footprint acres for these types of projects. We did not go back and do plan amendments for other appropriations to reflect this guidance, but did follow that direction in our reporting. As a result we reported 1260 acres less than was planned. Third, our trout stream riparian enhancement work over-estimated the amount that we could complete, resulting in a shortfall of 424 acres. The work for this part of the appropriation was completed during the last 6 months that the money was available, preventing a plan amendment to reflect the change in acreage output. We will know better in the future how to estimate acres for this type of work. The fourth reason for our shortfall was an amendment from a fish passage project on the Mississippi River at Little Falls to a channel restoration project on the Buffalo River. As previously mentioned, when the plan was written we expected to report the full benefitted acreage for the fish passage project. When we amended to plan to spend that money on the Buffalo River, there was no corresponding change to our planned output acres as reflected in table 1. This was not changed mainly because the original version of ML2010 accomplishment plan does not include a “Table 1” as shown in the online version.

They have been very busy contracting stream projects due to the flood of 2012, and this unexpected development kept us from completing the project on time. A design for the project was paid for with this appropriation. The project will be built in 2016 using flood damage money from the State of Minnesota.An instream habitat project was completed on West Beaver Creek. The project narrowed the stream channel to improve instream habitat and better transport fine sediment. Instream habitat was also enhanced, and bank stability improved to reduce erosion.Riparian habitat was enhanced at fourteen coldwater streams and two warmwater streams. These projects will enhance native prairie plants that will improve bank stability and instream cover. Prairie species also encourage narrow and deep stream channels that better move fine sediment, improving habitat for fish and invertebrates. Habitat practices included brush removal, prescribed burns, control of invasive plants, and planting of native species.Lake riparian habitat was enhanced at nine locations. These projects were done cooperatively through grants to local organizations. Mowed turf grass was replaced with native plants with deep roots that are better at stabilizing the shoreline and provide habitat for species such as frogs and other aquatic animals. These parcels are also open to public fishing.We permanently protected lakeshore habitat at eight locations, covering 276 acres. These parcels will protect intact lake shoreline that has been shown to be critical to fish reproduction, and to preventing shoreland erosion. We also protected one parcel on a trout stream through a conservation easement. This will protect coldwater conditions and habitat in the stream through the preservation of riparian vegetation. This parcel will also be open to public fishing.We fell short of our planned output acreage for this appropriation due to a number of factors. First, our protection acreage can vary depending on the relative amount of upland land that is purchased with adjoining waterfront. Sometimes parcels are a narrow strip of lakeshore, while at other times a parcel may be quite deep and have considerable upland that is purchased. For this appropriation, our acquisitions leaned toward primarily waterfront land resulting in a shortfall of 98 acres. Second, when this accomplishment plan was written we planned to be able to account for benefitted upstream acres for fish passage projects. During a plan amendment for a different appropriation we were given direction by the council that we should only count footprint acres for these types of projects. We did not go back and do plan amendments for other appropriations to reflect this guidance, but did follow that direction in our reporting. As a result we reported 1260 acres less than was planned. Third, our trout stream riparian enhancement work over-estimated the amount that we could complete, resulting in a shortfall of 424 acres. The work for this part of the appropriation was completed during the last 6 months that the money was available, preventing a plan amendment to reflect the change in acreage output. We will know better in the future how to estimate acres for this type of work. The fourth reason for our shortfall was an amendment from a fish passage project on the Mississippi River at Little Falls to a channel restoration project on the Buffalo River. As previously mentioned, when the plan was written we expected to report the full benefitted acreage for the fish passage project. When we amended to plan to spend that money on the Buffalo River, there was no corresponding change to our planned output acres as reflected in table 1. This was not changed mainly because the original version of ML2010 accomplishment plan does not include a “Table 1” as shown in the online version.

Land acquired in fee must remain open to hunting and fishing, consistent with the capacity of the land, during the open season, as determined in writing by the commissioner of natural resources. A list of proposed fee title and easement acquisitions, stream habitat restorations and enhancements, and lake habitat restorations and enhancements must be provided as part of the required accomplishment plan.",,"Restored 18 acres, protected 286 acres and enhanced 242 acres of stream habitat.",,585000,"USFWS, State Bonding, Ramsey Washington Watershed, Great River Greening, Cuyuna Scout Camp, Whitefish Area Property Owners Association, City of Jackson, Le Sueur County, Martin SWCD, landowner donations, Leech Lake Area Watershed Foundation, RIM",3404400,44900,,1.7,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,State Government,"Accomplishments of the appropriation include: i) protection of 3.9 miles of shoreline; ii) modification of 4 lake outlet structures to allow fish passage, benefiting 1,264 acres; iii) enhanced river and stream functions at 15 sites, benefiting over 17 river miles; and iv) enhance 4.5 miles of shoreline habitat on publicly-owned lakeshore.",,"We completed six fish passage projects, benefiting 1,311 acres of habitat that will now be accessible to migrating fish and mussels. These projects were modifications to dams that will allow fish to bypass these former barriers. One fish passage project on Chester Creek planned for this appropriation was not completed due to delays in contracting for construction by our project partner, the city of Duluth. They have been very busy contracting stream projects due to the flood of 2012, and this unexpected development kept us from completing the project on time. A design for the project was paid for with this appropriation. The project will be built in 2016 using flood damage money from the State of Minnesota.An instream habitat project was completed on West Beaver Creek. The project narrowed the stream channel to improve instream habitat and better transport fine sediment. Instream habitat was also enhanced, and bank stability improved to reduce erosion.Riparian habitat was enhanced at fourteen coldwater streams and two warmwater streams. These projects will enhance native prairie plants that will improve bank stability and instream cover. Prairie species also encourage narrow and deep stream channels that better move fine sediment, improving habitat for fish and invertebrates. Habitat practices included brush removal, prescribed burns, control of invasive plants, and planting of native species.Lake riparian habitat was enhanced at nine locations. These projects were done cooperatively through grants to local organizations. Mowed turf grass was replaced with native plants with deep roots that are better at stabilizing the shoreline and provide habitat for species such as frogs and other aquatic animals. These parcels are also open to public fishing.We permanently protected lakeshore habitat at eight locations, covering 276 acres. These parcels will protect intact lake shoreline that has been shown to be critical to fish reproduction, and to preventing shoreland erosion. We also protected one parcel on a trout stream through a conservation easement. This will protect coldwater conditions and habitat in the stream through the preservation of riparian vegetation. This parcel will also be open to public fishing.We fell short of our planned output acreage for this appropriation due to a number of factors. First, our protection acreage can vary depending on the relative amount of upland land that is purchased with adjoining waterfront. Sometimes parcels are a narrow strip of lakeshore, while at other times a parcel may be quite deep and have considerable upland that is purchased. For this appropriation, our acquisitions leaned toward primarily waterfront land resulting in a shortfall of 98 acres. Second, when this accomplishment plan was written we planned to be able to account for benefitted upstream acres for fish passage projects. During a plan amendment for a different appropriation we were given direction by the council that we should only count footprint acres for these types of projects. We did not go back and do plan amendments for other appropriations to reflect this guidance, but did follow that direction in our reporting. As a result we reported 1260 acres less than was planned. Third, our trout stream riparian enhancement work over-estimated the amount that we could complete, resulting in a shortfall of 424 acres. The work for this part of the appropriation was completed during the last 6 months that the money was available, preventing a plan amendment to reflect the change in acreage output. We will know better in the future how to estimate acres for this type of work. The fourth reason for our shortfall was an amendment from a fish passage project on the Mississippi River at Little Falls to a channel restoration project on the Buffalo River. As previously mentioned, when the plan was written we expected to report the full benefitted acreage for the fish passage project. When we amended to plan to spend that money on the Buffalo River, there was no corresponding change to our planned output acres as reflected in table 1. This was not changed mainly because the original version of ML2010 accomplishment plan does not include a “Table 1” as shown in the online version. Instead there are a series of less organized tables that allow for a more narrative description of the work. The resulting shortfall in acres from this change was 564 acres.In total, these differences from the accomplishment plan account for 2346 acres, which would explain the difference between the original plan and what we have reported for output. We have learned several lessons regarding output acres since this early appropriation. We will work hard to have our outputs better match the accomplishment plan in future reporting.",7/1/2010,6/30/2015,Outdoor Heritage Fund,Completed,,,Brian ,Nerbonne,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,500 Lafayette Road,St. Paul,MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement",Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,,"Aitkin, Becker, Beltrami, Blue Earth, Carver, Cass, Chisago, Cook, Crow Wing, Dakota, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Hennepin, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Jackson, Kandiyohi, Lake, Le Sueur, Martin, Meeker, Morrison, Murray, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Ramsey, Redwood",,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-acquisition,,,,,43.584951,-91.827529
