The total TP load into Lake Emma is 5,676 lbs/year. Lake Emma will require a 2,224 total TP load reduction, with a 1761 lbs/year load reduction from Lake Ann specifically given it is located directly upstream. Projects that reduce the amount of sediment (and associated TP) entering CD 10 will address the load reductions called for in the Lake Ann and Emma TMDL Implementation Plan (Wenck Associates, 2012).

The target is to reduce loading by 2,471.25 tons/year, which is a 33.73% reduction. Red Lake County SWCD has targeted ten sites for implementation of structural agricultural practices based on data analysis obtained from using the DRAFT Clearwater River WRAPs and TMDL Reports, Water Quality Decision Support System (WQDSS) tool, DNR Stressor ID database, and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) models. The data identified the Lower Clearwater River subwatershed as having the highest sediment yield in the Clearwater River Watershed, highlighted fields in the subwatershed with the highest sediment loading, and even showed specific locations in the field which were most vulnerable to erosion. Red Lake County SWCD conducted an Erosion Site Inventory in 2019, which verified the information from the tools/models and found landowners in these priority areas that were eager to fix the erosion problems on their fields.

As a result, numerous first & second priority source zones known as Tier 1 & Tier 2 areas were recognized. These zones are located within the ERW's sub-watersheds Mayhew Lake & Big Elk Lake. The TMDL Report identified spring time phosphorus loading as the main concern for Mayhew Lake, whereas summer loads dominate the Big Elk Lake nutrient impairment/Elk River turbidity impairment. Other riparian areas are considered as third priority for potential watershed impact & restoration potential. This study has pinpointed the locations within the watershed where the phosphorus originates from, as well as strategies that may be undertaken to reduce nutrient loading. While we have been able to provide outreach to landowners within these targeted high priority areas, develop site-specific Best Management Practices (BMPs), & design plans to implement projects, further assistance is still needed to get this conservation work on the ground. BMPs were strategically chosen to receive maximum pollution reduction benefits. Types of BMPs include but are not limited to SSTS, nutrient management, feedlot runoff control, manure storage, riparian pasture management, & cropland & streambank erosion control projects.

Recent advanced modeling by the MN DNR and Metropolitan Council of aquifer supplies, in conjunction with predicted demand, indicate the major metropolitan area aquifers are currently subject to extraction rates that exceed recharge. Simply stated, we are mining our groundwater. In addition to supply concerns, several surface waters within the metro area, most notably White Bear Lake, are experiencing impacts due to reduced aquifer levels associated with excessive groundwater extraction. Sustainable groundwater strategies will need to influence both the supply and use side of the water budget. Supply can be increased through efforts that infiltrate precipitation into the soil; use can be decreased by implementing efficiencies, and the use of alternative water sources. The Metro Conservation Districts (MCD) propose to provide groundwater conservation planning protocols to member districts for implementation on large-acreage, public campuses (e.g. public schools, hospitals, and government facilities). These areas are targeted due to their educational benefits, likelihood of stakeholder buy in and implementation, magnitude of potential impact, and opportunity for school district-wide implementation. This project will provide and apply a systematic approach to identify and rank groundwater conservation BMPs in terms of cost-effectiveness. Similar to the statewide benefits provided through the stormwater retrofit analysis process, MCD is confident this protocol will expand to all areas of the state, thereby ultimately providing long-lasting, far-reaching groundwater conservation efforts. Because this ranking stems from a thorough understanding of both the benefits of a project and the associated costs, the findings will inform and facilitate adoption of new groundwater conservation standards by regulatory entities.

The quality of raw water they take in seasonally fluctuates. Spring runoff and large rainfall events are the biggest contributors to poor raw water quality. Sediments, organics, and other contaminants get washed off the landscape and into our drainage systems, especially in urban areas. The City is looking to minimize these fluctuations by installing a series of up to nine BMPs to treat 935 acres of untreated urban stormwater. The proposed spent lime filter and pretreatment structures will capture organics and annually remove 145 lbs. of Total Phosphorus (64%) and 53.5 tons of Total Suspended Solids (88%) for the project area . The 935-acre project area is divided into two subcatchments. One is 135-acres and discharges into the Mississippi River about 900 feet up gradient, and on the same side of the river as the City's intake pipe. The second area contains about 800-acres of untreated urban drainage that discharges just downstream of the intake but is within the same pool of raw water. The Tenth Street Dam by St. Cloud State University makes up the river pool in which the City draws their water. By targeting these subcatchments, the City can help protect their drinking water source from sediment and excess nutrients, two of the most concerning pollutants identified in the St. Cloud Source Water Protection plan. The proposed BMPs will include pretreatment structures with energy dissipation to capture sediment and organic materials. The treatment train will conclude with a spent lime filter system. The spent lime filter will be located just upstream of the storm sewer outfall and will capture dissolved phosphorus from the stormwater before entering the Mississippi River. The spent lime filter media will be supplied by the City's Drinking Water Treatment Facility because spent lime is a waste product generated by treating raw water.

A Request for Proposal (RFP) was posted on the CPL website in August, 2012. This document contained grant program information, application requirements and scoring criteria, grant reporting requirements, and state agency contacts. A list of ECP Projects and criteria for each was developed by conservation biologists so grant applicants could easily apply and receive funding for commonly-accepted restoration and enhancement conservation projects. The RFP and grant agreements incorporated appropriate principles and criteria from LSOHC’s FY13 Call for Funding Requests and associated legislation. Simplified application processes were in place for applicants requesting up to $25,000 or ECP grants. Grants were selected for funding once in the full for the Traditional cycle, and ECP applications were approved continuously throughout the year by CPL staff. CPL staff reviewed applications to make sure they were complete and met grant program requirements. Technical Review Committee(s), selected by the Commissioner of Natural Resources, reviewed and scored applications based on established criteria. These committees included representatives from DNR, BWSR, the University of MN, state universities or private colleges, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and other appropriate members from government, non-profit organizations, and private businesses. A final ranking committee made up of the Directors of the DNR Divisions of Fish and Wildlife, Ecological Resources/Waters, and Forestry considered TRC, Division and Regional DNR comments, and recommended projects and funding levels to the Commissioner of Natural Resources. The Commissioner made the final decisions on all projects funded and funding levels. Efforts were made to evenly distribute the selected grants by geographic location and activity. CPL staff worked with grantees to ensure financial reviews, grant agreements, and any other necessary paperwork was completed. Grantees submitted annual accomplishment reports, accounting for the use of grant and match funds, and outcomes in measures of wetlands, prairies, forests, and fish, game, and wildlife habitat restored, enhanced, and protected. The report also included an evaluation of these results. A final report was required by all grantees. CPL staff submitted accomplishment reports to LSOHC. Accomplishment information was also posted on the CPL website. Grant administration costs were billed using actual costs. These costs included salary and fringe for grants staff, direct support services, travel, supplies, and expense. An internal Service Level Agreement (SLA) was developed with DNR’s Management Information Systems to update and manage the online grant application system. (This budget item is included in the Contracts line in the attached Budget Table.) Applicants were required to budget for DNR Land Acquisition costs that are necessary to support the land acquisition process for parcels to be conveyed to the DNR.

Application process:  A Request for Proposal/Program Manual was posted on the CPL website in August 2015. Document contains all grant program information.  Applications are submitted on the online grant application system. Applicants use the mapping tool in the application to map project sites. Applications are accepted until September 2015 for round 1 of all grant cycles. Expedited Conservation Project (ECP) applications and applications for less than $25,000 have a shorter application form. The application system accepts ECP applications until funding runs out, but is designed for 5 rounds of applications. Traditional (statewide) applications were accepted once, Metro applications were accepted twice, and ECP applications were accepted three times.  Grant Selection Process:  Cpl Grant Program Staff review applications for completeness. Technical Review Committees, selected by the Commissioner of Natural Resources, evaluate applications based on criteria below. A final score is given to all applications. Committees include representatives from the DNR, BWSR, UMN, USFWS, USFS, counties, and other local government and non-profit organizations. A final ranking committee of Directors of the DNR Divisions of Fish and Wildlife, Ecological Resources/Waters, and Forestry consider the technical review committee, division and regional DNR comments, and recommend projects and funding to the Commissioner. ECP grants are reviewed by CPL staff, using criteria established for each type of project, and make recommendations. Division of Fish and Wildlife leadership make final decisions. CPL Grant Program Staff work with grantees to complete financial reviews, grant agreements, and other paperwork. Work may not begin until grant contract is executed. Applications are evaluated on these criteria:  Amount of habitat restored, enhanced, or protected Local Support Degree of collaboration Urgency Multiple benefits Consistency with current conservation science Adjacent to protected lands Full funding of project Budget/cost effectiveness Public access for hunting and fishing Use of native plant materials Applicants' capacity to successfully complete and sustain work Project Reviews and Reporting:  Grantees submit annual accomplishment reports on forms provided by CPL staff, based on LSOHC report forms. Reports account for the use of grant and match funds, and outcomes in measures of wetlands, prairies, forests, and fish, game, and wildlife habitat restored, enhanced, and protected. The report must include an evaluation of these results. A final report is required by all grantees 30 days after project completion. CPL Administration Budget: Grant administration costs total $144,000, include salary/fringe for grants staff, direct and necessary costs, travel, supplies, and expenses. An Internal Service Level Agreement (SLA) is developed with MNIT to update/manage the online grant application system.  DNR Land Acquisition Costs:  Applicants are required to budget for DNR Land Acquisition costs that are necessary to support the land acquisition process for parcels to be conveyed to the DNR. These costs are billed to awarded grants on a professional services basis DNR Technical Support:  The Division of Fish and Wildlife provides ongoing technical guidance, helping applicants prepare grant proposals and meet requirements for working on state lands. Project development and oversight is provided by area managers and additional guidance is provided for land acquisitions.  Grantee Payment:  Grantees are paid on reimbursement basis, meaning payment is made to the grantee after work has been performed or materials purchased, but before the vendor is paid by the grantee. Grantees provide proof that work is completed or a purchase made to receive payment. Proof that the vendor was paid must be submitted to CPL staff before additional grant payments are made. Payment advances may be made for acquisitions with a signed purchase agreement. Partial payments are allowed. Funds are built into grants for required Legacy logo signage and forms of acknowledgement/notification including, but not limited to, local news advertisements announcing completion of grantees projects.   ",2015-07-01,2019-11-18,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,"Kathy ",Varble,"MN DNR","500 Lafayette Road Box 20","St. Paul",MN,55155,"(651) 259-5216",kathy.varble@state.mn.us,Grants/Contracts,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Becker, Brown, Carlton, Carver, Cass, Dakota, Douglas, Fillmore, Goodhue, Grant, Hennepin, Itasca, Kanabec, Kandiyohi, Kittson, Koochiching, Lake, Lake of the Woods, Martin, Meeker, Mille Lacs, Murray, Nobles, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Pine, Pipestone, Polk, Pope, Ramsey, Rock, Sherburne, Sibley, St. Louis, Stevens, Washington, Wilkin","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/conservation-partners-legacy-grant-program-statewide-and-metro-habitat-phase-vii,,,,

The commissioner shall contract with the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota to provide an independent review of the department's drinking water contaminants of emerging concern program. The review must include an assessment of the process used by the department to rank contaminants that are threats to drinking water supplies and include a comparison of efforts at the department with efforts by other states and the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The review must be submitted to the Clean Water Council and the chairs and ranking minority members of the House of Representatives and Senate committees and divisions with jurisdiction over environment and natural resources by June 1, 2016.","The Contaminants of Emerging Concern Program reviews and evaluates available information for at least 20 contaminants (screening and ranking) and completes risk assessments for 10 contaminants, resulting in published health-based guidance.

East Goose Lake total phosphorus (TP) and Chlorophyll-a levels average nearly 4 times shallow lake State standards. High nutrient levels have resulted in a lake that is devoid of vegetation and dominated by algae, including blue-green algae. VLAWMO seeks funding to perform a 2-phase alum treatment on East Goose Lake, as the most cost-effective means to remove biologically available phosphorus from the water column in East Goose and also improve the unnamed wetland, locally referred to as West Goose, located directly downstream (62'0126). Studies conducted on East Goose Lake show that 88% of East Goose Lake's phosphorus loading is internal. Reports that provide more detail include the TMDL (Wenck, 2014) and feasibility study (Barr, 2018). A 91% overall reduction in phosphorus is needed to meet the MPCA TP standard for shallow lakes (Wenck, 2014). Historical accumulated inputs combined with external inputs led to the current internal load. East Goose Lake was the discharge point for the White Bear Lake Wastewater Treatment Plant from the 1930s to the 1960s. Addressing problems in East Goose lake are important because it is part of the headwaters of Lambert Creek, tributary to East Vadnais Lake, which is the drinking water reservoir for more than 430,000 St. Paul residents. This area is also identified by the MDA Source Water Protection Area Map as High Priority (See attachments). External loading has been and continues to be reduced in the subwatershed. Best management practices (BMPs) have been completed including stormpond additions (N = 7), a network of raingardens on County Rd. F, and major redevelopment BMPs.

The Wassermann Lake TMDL attributes 505 lb/yr of phosphorus to internal loading, requiring an 88% reduction. An estimated 374 lb/yr of this internal load is attributable to internal sediment release. By implementing a buffered alum treatment, the Minnehaha Creek Watershed District (District) will be able to achieve an estimated 90% reduction of internal sediment release, effectively addressing the largest contributing factor to Wassermann Lake's Impairment. Over the last three years, the District has prepared to maximize the efficacy of an in-lake treatment through a multipronged strategy that includes common carp management, wetland restoration, alum treatment of a watershed source west of Lake Wassermann, and implementing stormwater regulations on all new development in the subwatershed. This strategy has effectively managed both internal release not attributable to sediment release and watershed loading to the maximum extent possible, making this treatment a final step towards restoring Lake Wassermann.

Both lakes are approximately 40 acres in size and surrounded by watersheds with moderate to low imperviousness. Both lakes are included on the MPCA's 303(d) list as impaired for aquatic recreation due to excessive nutrients. Lake Augusta and Sunfish Lake were included in a watershed restoration and protection strategies (WRAPS) study and total maximum daily load (TMDL) performed from 2012 to 2014. The WRAPS study identified internal loading as the primary source of phosphorus to each lake and recommended in-lake alum treatments to improve water quality in each lake to achieve MPCA water quality standards. The goal of the Lake Augusta and Sunfish Lake alum treatments is to reduce internal phosphorus loading in each lake by at least 80 percent, resulting in phosphorus load reductions of 252 lbs/year in Lake Augusta and 129 lbs/year in Sunfish Lake. These reductions will meet the load reductions identified in the WRAPS and TMDL report and are essentially the only feasible options to achieve MPCA water quality standards in these lakes. The watersheds to these lakes are not densely developed and stormwater best management practices are already present, reducing phosphorus loading to the lakes from external sources. In addition to the alum treatment, the LMRWMO will implement a voluntary rain barrel program, a shoreline buffer survey on Sunfish Lake to identify potential locations for improvements, and targeted communication with residents to encourage buffer enhancement. These efforts will further reduce the phosphorus reaching the lake from external sources. Due to the very limited external load, alum treatment of these lakes is expected to be effective for 20 years or more.

Work was accomplished by strategically coordinating and focusing conservation efforts within a connected network of critical lands that stretches from the area's urban core to its rural perimeter, including portions of 16 counties. Projects and activities took place within science-based corridors and were guided by the Minnesota Statewide Conservation and Preservation Plan, Minnesota's Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy, as well as numerous local and resource-specific plans. This project addressed several recommendations of the Statewide Conservation and Preservation Plan: Protect priority land habitats Protect critical shorelands of streams and lakes Restore land, wetlands, and wetland-associated watersheds Improve connectivity and access to outdoor recreation The Mapping and Coordination element of the MeCC Partnership provided coordination and leadership for the partnership by Minnesota Land Trust staff and improved prioritization through enhanced database development and mapping of the corridors by DNR staff. During this phase of work, the coordination activity included regular meetings of the partners to share information and accomplishments, assisting partners with preparation of reports, compiling overall partnership results, and assisting DNR staff with the mapping, database development, and results tracking. The mapping activity included successful development and refinement of a GIS-based database to track historic and current MeCC projects. The database allows partners to generate tables and reports for status and accomplishment reporting for a variety of MeCC components - from project types, to funding sources, to activities, to partnerships, to location analysis. It also links to an interactive web map where the public can see the locations of completed projects.

The principal strategies employed by the Program to achieve these goals included: 1) competitive grants to local and regional governments to restore degraded habitats; 2) competitive grants that support the acquisition of or conservation easements on strategically important parcels of terrestrial, wetland, or riparian habitat; 3) incentive grants to local governments to address other conservation needs such as land cover inventories, natural resource based land use decision tools, and ordinance revisions to support conservation efforts; and 4) natural resource based workshops on topics of interest to local government staff and officials. The 2009 appropriation concludes DNR Central region's Metro Greenways Program, which is sun setting after 13 years. This final allotment of $1,175,000 was used to fund a total of 21 projects and to develop and offer six new natural resource-based workshops. Combined, the restoration and protection projects conserved an additional 375 total acres in the 12-county greater metropolitan region, almost meeting Metro Greenways' combined target of 385 acres of lands restored and protected: Five restoration grants totaling $90,000 were awarded to three counties and one city. In combination with other funds, a total of approximately 255 acres of city, county, and regional park lands were restored to native vegetation, primarily prairie and savanna. The newly restored acreage was over two times more than targeted for this result (120 acres). Six protection projects were awarded a total of $650,000. Only three projects totaling $370,000 were initiated and completed (Lindstrom, Grannis, and Niebur), resulting in the protection of just 120 acres of the 325 acre projected target for Metro Greenways. The city of Lindstrom acquired a new 64 acre Allemansratt ""wilderness"" park that will give residents the chance to explore its several clear lakes and deciduous hardwood forest. Two grants to Dakota County added a total of 56 acres under conservation easements to its green infrastructure network being created by the Farmland and Natural Areas Program. Unfortunately, a $200,000 grant to Anoka Conservation District did not materialize and a $10,000 grant awarded to Chanhassen was turned down. These funds were put toward other projects. A Washington County project fell through very late in the biennium, leaving an $80,000 balance for this result category. Metro Greenways' Community Conservation Assistance Program awarded 13 grants to cities, counties and special districts that supported a variety of locally-specific conservation needs: a) to obtain land cover and urban tree canopy (UTC) inventories; b) to develop natural resource-based land use decision models; c) to create interjurisdictional partnerships to protect high quality natural areas; and d) to write new or revise existing ordinances to protect natural resources. In addition to these grants, the Program organized and facilitated two annual events (Rendez-Vous) that brought all DNR Community Assistance grantees (2008 and 2009 appropriations) together for full days of information-sharing and peer-to-peer learning. The DNR also convened the three cities undertaking urban tree canopy (UTC) inventories, along with the University of Minnesota forestry and extension service, U.S. Forestry Service, and Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, to hear about each city's findings and proposed applications of UTC data. This third result area also funded the development and offering of six new natural resource-based workshops in 2010/2011 for local government staff and appointed officials. These workshops were offered in the metro area and were promoted by Government Training Services to its clientele (local government commissioners). Almost 325 local government staff and officials (62% from cities; 14% counties; 10% townships; and14% special districts and others) attended these workshops on shoreland conservation, stormwater management, and the incorporation of natural resources into land use planning and engineering design. The workshops all received excellent evaluations from attendees. Project Results Use and Dissemination Press releases were sent to local newspapers where projects were funded. The DNR convened all of the Community Conservation Assistance (CCA) project managers in November of 2009 and in February 2011 to share the findings of their conservation work. CCA Project Profiles were drafted and posted on the DNR website. Protection and restoration project information is available through the Metro Conservation Corridor partnership map created for public use. The CCA deliverables will be tried and tested as part of the Results Outcomes effort by the State of Minnesota.

The Metro Conservation District's (MCD) Sub-Watershed Analysis (SWA) program provides these capacity-building services and united efforts across 11 Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs). The SWA program has had quantifiable impact on water quality improvement efforts. During the first 36 months of funding, this process resulted in 63 analyses completed or underway and identified over 4,000 site-specific BMPs. Many CWF project grant applications are the result of SWAs propelling cost-effective projects onto local priority lists.

When normalizing costs they ranged from $5- $25 per cubic foot of treatment volume. When normalizing costs in terms of dollars per pound of TP removed over 20-years, costs ranged from $644-$8,014 per pound of TP. Beyond cost, each BMP was also ranked for total phosphorus removal, effectiveness of total phosphorus removal cost rank, and design challenges. The final step was to develop a report that summarized the methods, the modeling results, the BMP locations, cost and removal efficiencies, and recommendations. This report has been completed and as noted, identified 13 potential BMPs and all of the data that informed the development of those BMPs. Treatment efficiency ranged from 3-74 pounds per year of TP removal, with an average removal of 31 pounds. If all 13 BMPs were to be constructed they would remove approximately 399 pounds of TP per year, which would contribute significantly towards the City of Minneapolis? goal to reduce 400.4 pounds of TP per year to Minnehaha Creek and Lake Hiawatha.

The County ranks 10th and 13th in the State for corn and bean production, making much of the land vulnerable to erosion due to the planting of row crop. As a result, streams and ditches in the county see high sediment loads. Unless conservation practices that include erosion control and buffers along the county's surface waters are implemented, it is likely that soil loss through water erosion will increase. By using models to target high risk erosion lands, the Mower Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) has determined that between 49,000 and 62,000 acres in the county have the potential of eroding greater than the tolerable level. Other areas have been identified with existing practices in need of repair or a complete overhaul.

Very little stormwater infrastructure currently exists in the 573 acre Oak Glen Creek subwatershed, and it discharges 147,519 pounds of sediment and 353 pounds of phosphorus to the Mississippi River annually. Thanks to a previous Clean Water Fund grant, a project to stabilize a quarter-mile section of creek immediately downstream of this project will be substantially complete by the end of 2013. This stretch of creek was severely deteriorated due to extreme stormwater flow volumes and rates. The increased stormwater storage from this project will complement the stabilization efforts by providing a 51% reduction in peak flow rates. Additionally, the pond retrofit project is ideally located to treat 520 acres (90%) of the highly urbanized subwatershed fully developed prior to modern stormwater treatment practices. It will reduce annual sediment discharging from the site to the Mississippi River by 33% and total phosphorus by 31%.

Its Lower Otter Tail River (LOTR) reach is impaired for sediment. The LOTR begins at the dam of Orwell Reservoir near Fergus Falls and ends 48 river miles downstream at the confluence with the Bois de Sioux River at Breckenridge. No point sources contribute directly to the LOTR. Consequently, the turbidity impairment must be addressed through non-point measures. Current stream instability and bank erosion is largely a result of an 18-mile channel straightening completed by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s. This channel straightening reduced channel length and induced headcutting which has been a major contributor to channel instability and bank failure resulting in excessive sediment loading since that time. Bank instability is a significant contributing factor to the turbidity impairment in the LOTR. A TMDL study for this reach of the river was completed in 2006 with an implementation plan completed in 2007. An estimated 17 percent reduction in the 40,400 tons/year annual sediment load is necessary to meet the state standard. Since 2007, the Wilkin SWCD installed BMPs to hold the water back in contributing drainage systems and release it slower into the LOTR. The SWCD work has resulted in the retrofit of 40 miles of legal ditch systems with sediment controls (side inlets) and 300 acres of buffer strips. Cover cropping promotion resulted in excess of 20,000 acres of annual cover crops. The remaining implementation strategy will need to address in-stream sediment sources which will require a detailed channel restoration plan to stabilize streambank erosion and encourage natural stream functions. The detailed plan will provide a coordinated framework for future channel restoration. When implemented, the LOTR is expected to once again meet state standards.

This project involves the installation of 45 side-inlet structures into Wilkin County Ditch 3-2 and 7-1 and 22 acres of buffer strips along the entire systems. Eleven miles of continuous berm will also be constructed along the ditch. When installed these water quality practices will become a permanent part of the ditch system and will be maintained by the ditch authority. These ditches outlet to the Otter Tail River just upstream from Breckenridge, MN. Together these water quality BMPs will reduce sediment loading by 1,375 tons/year. This is about 20% of the total reduction needed to meet the goals of the Lower Otter Tail TMDL Implementation Plan. In addition, this project will reduce Phosphorus loading by 1,870 lbs/year. A TMDL study was conducted on the Otter Tail River by MPCA in 2006. Water quality monitoring was conducted by the USGS, MPCA and the Wilkin SWCD. Water quality data indicated that the Otter Tail River was impaired for turbidity due to sediment loading. The USGS estimated that the annual sediment load at the sampling site in Breckenridge, MN was 40,400 tons/year. MPCA determined that this annual sediment load would need to be reduced by 17 percent (6,868 tons/year) in order for the river to meet acceptable water quality standards. Since 2007 the Wilkin County has been working with landowner to install water quality BMPs into the county ditches that drain into the Otter Tail River. At this time all county ditches, except for CD 3-2 and 7-1 have had water quality BMPs incorporated into them. Work completed to date includes: over 40 miles of county ditches with sediment controls (side inlets) and over 300 acres of buffer strips.

Grants shall not be made for activities required to fulfill the duties of owners of lands subject to conservation easements. Grants shall not be made from appropriations in this paragraph for projects that have a total project cost exceeding $475,000. $319,000 of this appropriation may be spent for personnel costs and other administrative costs. Grantees may acquire land or interests in land. Easements must be permanent. Land acquired in fee must be open to hunting and fishing during the open season unless otherwise provided by state law. The program shall require a match of at least ten percent from nonstate sources for grants of $100,000 or less and a match of at least 15 percent from nonstate sources for grants over $100,000. Up to one-third of the match may be in-kind resources. For grant applications of $25,000 or less, the commissioner shall provide a separate, simplified application process. The criteria for evaluating grant applications over $25,000 must include the amount of habitat restored, enhanced, or protected; local support; encouragement of a local conservation culture; urgency; capacity to achieve multiple benefits; habitat benefits provided; consistency with current conservation science; adjacency to protected lands; full funding of the project; supplementing existing funding; public access for hunting and fishing during the open season; sustainability; degree of collaboration; and use of native plant materials. All projects must conform to the Minnesota statewide conservation and preservation plan. Wildlife habitat projects must also conform to the Minnesota wildlife action plan. Subject to the evaluation criteria and requirements of this paragraph and Minnesota Statutes, the commissioner of natural resources shall give priority to organizations that have a history of receiving or charter to receive private contributions for local conservation or habitat projects when evaluating projects of equal value. If acquiring land or a conservation easement, priority shall be given to projects associated with existing wildlife management areas under Minnesota Statutes, section 86A.05, subdivision 8; scientific and natural areas under Minnesota Statutes, sections 84.033 and 86A.05, subdivision 5; and aquatic management areas under Minnesota Statutes, sections 86A.05, subdivision 14, and 97C.02.

A 10% match from non-state sources is required for all grants. Match may be cash or in-kind resources. All match must be identified at the time of application. CPL Program Staff developed a Request for Proposal and Program Manual that incorporated the Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council’s (LSOHC) priorities, solicited applications and worked with applicants to submit scorable applications, oversee the grant selection process, prepare and execute grant documents, review expenditure documentation to ensure recipients are only reimbursed for allowable expenses, make reimbursement payments, monitor grant work, assist recipients with closing out their agreements, and prepare reports as required by the LSOHC. MS 97a.056 Subd. 3a directed the LSOHC to establish a conservation partners grant program to encourage and support local conservation efforts. Subsequent session law established additional guidelines and criteria for this program and authorized the DNR to administer it. Applicants describe the location of the work (county and ecological subsection), activity type, and habitat in their application. They also describe how their actions benefit habitat and fish, game and wildlife. For acquisition projects, applicants describe their parcel selection process. All projects address the priorities in the Minnesota Statewide Conservation and Preservation Plan, and Tomorrow's Habitat for the Wild and Rare. Funds for projects under this appropriation were available until June 30, 2015. In administering this program, the DNR complied with the Department of Administration- Office of Grants Management policies. Stakeholders were involved in this proposal as applicants or reviewers (if no conflict of interest exists). There was no known stakeholder opposition to this program. Grant Application Process A Request for Proposal (RFP) and Program Manual (PM) were posted on the CPL website in early August, 2011. These documents contained grant program information, application requirements and scoring criteria, grant reporting requirements, and state agency contacts. The RFP, PM, and all grant agreements incorporated appropriate principles and criteria from the LSOHC’s Call for Funding Requests – 2012 Appropriations and associated legislation. CPL Program Staff explored ways to reduce any real or perceived barriers in the application process. This included a survey(s) and/or discussion groups involving previous applicants and applicants to similar grant programs, and exploring the use of a pre-application system. The results were incorporated into the FY12 application process. Applications were submitted electronically using CPL’s Online Grant Application System (OLGA). All project sites were mapped using OLGA’s mapping tool. OLGA accepted applications beginning in August, 2011, until the deadline for the first round of grants in mid-September, 2011. The application system did not accept applications during the review process. Grants were selected for funding twice. Ungranted funds from the first cycle were available for use in a following cycle, or were distributed to current grantees to assist approved projects. DNR reserved the right to make additional awards under this announcement, consistent with DNR and Outdoor Heritage Fund policy and guidance, if additional funding became available, or if a grantee could not carry out their project as planned. Grant Selection Process CPL Grant Program Staff reviewed applications to make sure they were complete and met grant program requirements. Technical Review Committee(s), selected by the Commissioner of Natural Resources, reviewed and scored applications based on criteria established by the LSOHC, MN State Legislature, and DNR. These committees included representatives from DNR, BWSR, the University of MN, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, and other appropriate members from government, non-profit organizations, and private businesses. A final ranking committee made up of the Directors of the DNR Divisions of Fish and Wildlife, Ecological Resources/Waters, and Forestry considered TRC, Division and Regional DNR comments, and recommended projects and funding levels to the Commissioner of Natural Resources. The Commissioner made the final decision on the projects funded and funding levels. Projects could be fully or partially funded. Every effort was made to evenly distribute the selected grants by geographic location, activity, and funding level, with an objective of granting 50% of the funds to projects above $125,000, and 50% of the funds to projects below $125,000. CPL Grant Program staff worked with grantees to ensure financial reviews, grant agreements, and any other necessary paperwork was completed. Work did not begin until the grant was executed. Project Reviews and Reporting Project reviews were completed as required by Office of Grants Management Policy 08-10, Grant Monitoring. Grantees submitted annual accomplishment reports on forms provided by CPL staff, based on LSOHC report forms. Reports account for the use of grant and match funds, and outcomes in measures of wetlands, prairies, forests, and fish, game, and wildlife habitat restored, enhanced, and protected. The report included an evaluation of these results. A final report was required by all grantees within 30 days after the project was complete. CPL Grant Program staff submitted accomplishment reports to the LSOHC as required. Accomplishment information was also posted on the CPL website. CPL Administration Budget Grant administration costs were billed using actual costs. These costs included salary and fringe for grants staff, direct support services, travel, supplies, and expense. An internal Service Level Agreement (SLA) was developed with DNR’s Management Information Systems to update and manage the online grant application system. DNR Land Acquisition Costs Grantees were required to budget for DNR Land Acquisition costs that were necessary to support the land acquisition process for parcels to be conveyed to the DNR. These costs were billed to the grantees on a professional services basis and were paid with either grant or match funds. DNR Technical Support The Division of Fish and Wildlife estimates it provided $70,000 of ongoing technical guidance from Division field staff.

The Partridge River is a major tributary to the headwaters of the Crow Wing River, a highly recreated river for fishing and water enthusiasts. The Partridge River (07010106-518) was placed on the EPA's 303(d) list of impaired waters in 2014 for high E. coli contributions by livestock operations. E. coli reductions will be achieved through closure of nine outdated manure storage basins, installation of 6 livestock access control projects, increased buffer areas, and the construction of winter manure storage areas. Seven of the nine failure manure storage basins are placed in sandier soils within 300 feet of the river. Average water tables in the area indicate depths of 4.5 feet placing the basin floors at or into the water table. EPA studies have shown high levels of bacteria accumulating in shallow aquifers from outdated, poorly lined manure basins, or simply excavated into native soils. Livestock with unrestricted access to streams provide a direct source of E. coli to streams by defecation. In addition, this process loads nitrogen, phosphorus, and other nutrients directly to the stream. In conjunction, increased buffer areas provide filtering of run off from livestock wastes leading to a reduction of E. coli loading. This proposed Clean Water Fund Project will augment Federal 319 funds already obtained in the area to provide 75% cost share to landowners. A Phase I & II effort targeting access control grazing and other forms of livestock management BMPs in the targeted area is anticipated to complete a full recovery regarding livestock contributions of E.coli in the Partridge River.

The City of Apple Valley is proposing a combination of two enhancements to achieve a 61 pound reduction in phosphorus. First is the installation of an iron enhanced sand filter to the banks of the pond. When water levels increase after rain events, water will flow through the filter before leaving the pond. Particulate phosphorus will be removed as water passes through the sand and dissolved phosphorus would chemically bind to the iron in the filter. The second enhancement is a phased application of aluminum sulfate (alum) to the pond. The alum application will be distributed over three years to maintain healthy pH levels in the pond. Sediments in the pond bottom store phosphorus that is periodically released into the water column when certain conditions occur throughout the year. Alum chemically binds and locks phosphorus in the pond sediments. Water clarity will improve after application of alum and promote growth of aquatic plants, improving wildlife habitat and aesthetics.

This 66 acre catchment receives runoff water from residential, commercial downtown and light industrial areas. The park is used as a playground in summer and an ice skating rink in winter. The storm sewer is not sized to handle runoff from wider streets and more impervious surfaces and the outlet in South Lindstrom Lake is under water. During high rain events sediment is carried into the lake and creates a large delta three to four feet below the surface of the water, which also creates a hazard at the private beach area where the outlet is located. Due to the lack of upstream treatment, debris (cigarette butts, papers, cups) is carried directly into the lake and deposited on the shoreline.

This use is at risk from tens-of-thousands of old wells (residential, commercial, agricultural, and industrial) that are unused and unsealed. These wells pose a significant health and safety hazard to Anoka County well water users by creating a direct, unmaintained conduit that can introduce contaminants (e.g. pesticides, nutrients, heavy metals, salts, hydrocarbons, and pathogens) into groundwater supplies. Moreover, the highly permeable surficial sands of the Anoka Sand Plain are believed to be a significant source of groundwater recharge for several of the major aquifers that supply the water needs throughout the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area. As such, protection of Metro Area groundwater supplies requires protection of Anoka County recharge areas. We're helping to solve this problem by using this grant to offer cost-share funds of 50-75% to incentivize landowners to hire MN Department of Health licensed well sealing contractors to seal unused wells. Due to the large-scope of the problem, we're proposing to prioritize and target well sealing cost-share promotion. Unused wells within Drinking Water Supply Management Areas (DWSMAs), those that are deep and intersect multiple aquifers, and those that have the earliest original installation date will be targeted. DWSMAs represents about 75% of all drinking water use in Anoka county and according to a recent Anoka County Public Health and Environmental Services (ACPHES) study, at least 2,354 properties in Anoka County DWSMAs are known to have a high potential of having an unused/unsealed well. Our goal is to seal up to 125 high priority unused wells, which we expect to abate about 5% of the problem within DWSMAs.

",,"Activity 1 Complete design and all permit requirements for a ""sweeping"" electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1. The MN DNR believed that the best approach to keep Invasive Carp out of the upper Mississippi River watershed was to close the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock. The lock is administered by the US Army Corps of Engineers and required an act of Congress to shut down. Minnesota senators and representatives successfully added an amendment to the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) that called for Upper St. Anthony Falls lock closure within one year of passage of the bill. The bill passed both chambers of the federal legislature and was signed into law by President Obama on June 10, 2014. Lock closure happened June 10, 2015.   Prior to lock closure, the MN DNR initiated an invasive carp deterrent project at Lock and Dam 1 based on the status of carp population at the time and the uncertain political will to close a federal lock.  The DNR contracted with Smith-Root Inc. to design an electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1.  With the passage of the 2014 WRRDA bill, construction of a Lock and Dam 1 barrier was not necessary. But, due to the timing of passage of the bill, there was no cost savings by terminating the design contract for the electrical barrier. Also, by completing the design, the MN DNR has a better understanding of the costs, potential effectiveness, and safety concerns associated with this technology. The contractor submitted a final design to the DNR in 2014. Activity 2 Complete design, acquire permits, and construct deterrent barriers in Minnesota's portion of the Missouri River watershed. Waters in the southwest corner of Minnesota were vulnerable to Invasive Carp expansion from the Missouri River watershed. MN DNR fisheries identified locations to prevent Invasive carp from entering Minnesota waters and from entering the Mississippi River and Minnesota River tributaries through watershed breaches. • Okabena Creek - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR acquired a flowage easement and removed two road culverts. With these culverts removed, the township gravel road acts as a physical berm to separate the watersheds. • Okabena Creek Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier by removing two small culverts and installing a 12 foot by 6 foot electrified culvert. The barrier prevents upstream movement of fish. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Soil and Water Conservation District and a private landowner to build up an earthen dike berm to disconnect the watersheds. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Highway Department and the Minnesota Department of Transportation to install a grate system and tile line caps to prevent fish from moving across a watershed boundary via the tile line system. • Minnesota River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Little Sioux River - Rock River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch and an outlet structure was modified to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Illinois Lake Protective Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier on a WMA downstream of the outlet of Illinois Lake. Activity 3 Develop cost share agreement with State of Iowa to construct barrier at Lower Gar Outlet. A joint powers agreement with Iowa DNR was executed to help share costs on a barrier to prevent Invasive Carp in the Missouri River watershed from entering Minnesota. An electric barrier at the outlet of Lower Gar Lake became fully operational in December 2012. Activity 4 Complete evaluation on feasibility of barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The Minnesota River is a free flowing system whose watershed covers much of southern Minnesota. The MN DNR contracted with the Water Resource Center at Minnesota State - Mankato on a project to evaluate several Minnesota River aspects including barrier feasibility.  Increasing the understanding of this system aided the DNR in evaluating deterrent barrier potential on the Minnesota River and its tributaries. Additionally, the project provided information on habitat suitability and described the Minnesota/Red River connection.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in July 2018. Activity 5 Implement and evaluate deterrent barriers at Lock and Dams. The susceptible portion of the St. Croix River is not conducive to electrical barriers due to the high level of recreational use (safety concerns) and the required cooperation from Wisconsin, which has expressed limited to no interest in constructing a barrier. The best alternative is exploring deterrent technologies in lock(s) below the confluence with the Mississippi River. The MN DNR contracted with the Minnesota Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center to evaluate the potential effectiveness of flow modifications and an existing acoustic deterrent in Mississippi River Lock and Dam 8 to prevent Invasive Carp movement.   A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in March 2019. Activity 6 Complete design, acquire permits and construct deterrent barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The uncertainty associated with a barrier (effectiveness, timeline, cost, native community impacts, and ability to construct) on the Minnesota River was high.  This was substantiated by the evaluation completed by Minnesota State Mankato (Activity 4).  Given this scenario, DNR Fisheries identified high value aquatic resources that could be protected at locations in tributaries.  Construction of the two electric barriers, Madison/Eagle lakes protective barrier and Elysian/Buffalo lakes protective barrier, were completed in February 2019. Activity 7 Lock and Dam 5 Acoustic Deterrent Feasibility Study Mississippi River Lock and Dam 5 was identified as a potential location for installation of an acoustic barrier to deter upstream movement of Invasive Carp.  Before any potential construction project, the DNR required a feasibility study to estimate the effectiveness, construction costs, and annual operation/maintenance costs.  The MN DNR contracted with the University of Minnesota-Duluth to complete the study.  Study results suggest further development of the technology was needed before deployment at this site.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in December 2018.   ",2012-07-01,2019-11-04,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Nick,Frohnauer,DNR,"500 Lafayette Road","St. Paul",MN,55155,651-259-5670,nick.frohnauer@state.mn.us,"Grants/Contracts, Restoration/Enhancement","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Blue Earth, Cottonwood, Hennepin, Jackson, Waseca",,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/protect-aquatic-habitat-asian-carp,,,,

In a preliminary analysis, a subwatershed area adjacent to Rice Lake was prioritized using already developed modeling information dating back to 2005. With the Rice Lake TMDL implementation plan ongoing, this area is a target for restoration projects and a place to have measurable results. The Stearns County Environmental Services Department (ESD) and Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD), through the Comprehensive Water Management Plan, developed a Pollutant Loading Model (PLM) in 2005 for riparian lot development. The PLM determines the amount of sediment and phosphorus discharged from each particular riparian lot into the adjacent lake or river, and also determines the size of Best Management Practice (BMP) needed to mitigate for development. The PLM has calculated pollution inputs and associated BMPs that will mitigate for impervious surface impacts.

Stearns County and the City of Sartell are partnering to reconstruct the road and replace outdated utilities and infrastructure. As part of the redevelopment process there is an opportunity to target multiple high-quality BMP locations that will only be accessible during the reconstruction process. There are three main components to this project. First, there are two major subcatchment areas that drain through the proposed construction area. One consists of 550 acres of residential housing and urban streets. The second is a 60-acre commercial use district. Both drainage areas combine for 44% of the City's developed area that discharges untreated stormwater to the Mississippi River. The goal is to strategically place BMPs, such as sedimentation structures with energy dissipation, baffles and weirs near Riverside Avenue and the stormwater outfalls into the Mississippi River. Second, due to high flows and failing infrastructure at the stormwater outfalls, there is approximately 400 LF of Mississippi River bank that needs to be stabilized and buffered to prevent additional sediment loss into the River. Third, the project will be the first step in a treatment train approach that will be created with the City's future West Side Reconstruction Project at which point BMPs such as sedimentation structures with energy dissipation, filtration practices and infiltration BMP's will be installed within the upstream subcatchment to treat stormwater and capture sediment from the watershed. This application proposes to construct up to ten BMPs to intercept and treat urban stormwater runoff and to stabilize 400 LF of Mississippi River streambank.

The project includes a combination of structural water quality improvements in the SLV-10 subwatershed north of the lake, retrofits (including iron enhanced sand filtration) to the Silver Lake bioretention basin, small scale best management practices (BMPs) throughout the watershed, and educational signage in Joy Park. The elements of this project will reduce phosphorus loading to Silver Lake by a combined 15 pounds per year or 40% of the current watershed load. This project will lower phosphorus concentrations and increase the frequency with which Silver Lake meets applicable Valley Branch Watershed District (VBWD) and MPCA water quality standards. Silver Lake is a 76-acre shallow lake bordering the cities of North St. Paul, Maplewood, and Oakdale in the VBWD. The lake receives runoff from an approximately 350-acre watershed of primarily residential land use. The lake is heavily used for recreation, including swimming and fishing. This intensive use is due in part to the presence of two parks adjacent to the lake: North St. Paul's Silver Lake Park along the south shore and Maplewood's Joy Park along the north shore. Other recreational uses include waterskiing, canoeing, and aesthetic viewing. Water quality in Silver Lake over the past 10 years has declined, as witnessed by a statistically significant increase in phosphorus concentrations and decrease in water clarity. The most recent 10-year average of total phosphorus concentration in Silver Lake is worse than the applicable MPCA standard, and the lake may be listed as impaired due to nutrients. Silver Lake was included in the VBWD WRAPS study, which identified strategies to restore lake water quality. Several elements of this project are among those strategies identified in the WRAPS study. In addition to improving water quality, the project will provide secondary benefits to habitat, recreation, and education.

Yet, county, watershed, and other state, tribal, and local agencies charged with enforcement and permit review often work in silos and infrequently coordinate with each other or share information. This leads to higher enforcement costs, conflicts between agencies, redundancy of inspections, property owner frustration, and reinforces negative stereotypes of regulatory agencies. The SSMAP seeks to break down barriers to communication and improve the regulatory process by creating an on-line, multi-agency permit application and data management program that is linked to property records and which simultaneously sends permit applications and notifications to the appropriate agencies and organizations. The SSMAP will automatically populates permit databases and updates property records. It can be routinely updated to provide links to the local SCWD and other sites that offer cost share, technical assistance, or design recommendations. Applicants will only need to fill out a single application which will be automatically routed to the County, watershed district, and SWCD.

The SSMAP allows property owners and contractors to apply and receive permits on-line -saving them time and money.

Wetlands were tiled and drained to increase the amount of farmable land. Excess water is directed to ditches or streams, which can cause erosion. These landscape changes contributed to water pollution, which has had a drastic impact on North and South Heron Lake (SHL), once key migratory waterfowl habitat. The purpose of this project is to reduce phosphorus entering SHL, which does not meet state standards for this pollutant. Too much phosphorus in a waterbody creates harmful algal blooms and decreased levels of dissolved oxygen, making it difficult for fish to live, aquatic plants to survive, and unpleasant for recreation. To address this, the Heron Lake Watershed District (HLWD) and Jackson Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) are partnering with landowners to implement projects to reduce phosphorus in the SHL watershed. Efforts are focused on County Ditch 3 (CD3), which flows into Okabena Creek and then SHL and Judicial Ditches (JD)14 and JD3, which also outlet into SHL. Projects include 15 alternative side inlets (ASI) on CD3, 4 on JD14, and a 4.2 acre wetland on JD3, providing an annual phosphorus load reduction of 2258 pounds, which equates to a 6.1 percent total reduction for the SHL watershed. These systems are in varying stages, ranging from approval of the preliminary engineering report (PER) to completion of the final engineering report (FER). The projects in this proposal build upon recent successes, including an existing Clean Water Fund Multi-purpose Drainage Management (MDM) grant and an EPA 319 grant. The HLWD has been selected to receive a Small Watersheds Focus Grant to implement practices in the SHL watershed over the next several years.

The Rum River WRAPS (2014) and recent work completed by Paul Radomski identified Spectacle Lake as the second most likely lake in the watershed (behind Lake Mille Lacs) to see substantial declines in water clarity with increasing nutrient loads. Increased nutrient loads are likely to occur as development and redevelopment increases in the shoreland areas; 35 new homes are platted for development within the next five years. Additionally, Isanti County has seen an increase in the conversion from seasonal to year-round homes on the lake; these changes nearly always result in an increase in impervious surface.

Through the Wakefield Lake TMDL process, implementation activities have been identified which include partnerships with the City of Maplewood to install BMPs in the watershed to directly benefit Wakefield Lake. RWMWD has researched, monitored and field tested the use of spent lime for stormwater quality treatment. Spent lime consists of calcium and carbonate and is a byproduct of the drinking water treatment process that has properties that allow it to bind with dissolved phosphorus. When water containing dissolved phosphorus contacts the lime material, calcium from the lime binds with the phosphorus and forms calcium phosphate which is a solid material and does not dissolve in the storm water, thus remaining within the treatment system. Although this is still an emerging concept, three years of monitoring a test spent lime system has shown promising results for the removal of both total and dissolved phosphorus. Total phosphorus removal through the system is approximately 60% and total dissolved phosphorus removal is approximately 70%. With the help of this grant source, RWMWD hopes to install a full scale spent lime filtration system on a City of Maplewood owned lot just upstream of Wakefield Lake at the southwest corner of Frost Avenue and Kennard Street to treat stormwater flow before it reaches the lake. This treatment system will achieve nearly 50% of the needed phosphorus external load reductions to Wakefield Lake as identified in the TMDL.

The Itasca County LWM Plan identifies this project as a priority due to its high phosphorus sensitivity (page 27), outstanding resource for Cisco refuge lakes and biological significance (page 34).

This information will be used to target landowners where practices can make quantifiable water quality improvements. Additionally, this project includes the creation and implementation of a web-based tool used within Steele, Waseca, Rice, and Le Sueur Counties to effectively and efficiently manage drainage systems. The software will track activities associated with public drainage systems, including history, digital archives, determinations, repair orders, improvements, inspections, and maintenance.
