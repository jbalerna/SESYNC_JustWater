Almost 4,200 acres of wetland habitat will be impacted. The proposal is comprised of two components - (1) projects to engineer and implement shallow lake and wetland enhancement activities; (2) funding to continue the existing Roving Habitat Crew in Region 3 to conduct habitat management work on public lands. ","Minnesota wetlands, besides being invaluable for waterfowl, also provide other desirable functions and values - habitat for a wide range of species, groundwater recharge, water purification, flood water storage, shoreline protection, and economic benefits. An estimated 90% of Minnesota's prairie wetlands have been lost, more than 50% of our statewide wetland resource. In remaining wetlands, benefits are too often compromised by degraded habitat quality due to excessive runoff and invasive plants and fish. This proposal will accomplish needed wetland habitat work throughout Minnesota, with a focus on the prairie region. ROVING HABITAT CREW - Numerous plans pertaining to wetlands and shallow lakes call for effective management of existing habitat to provide maximum benefits for wildlife. Past Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) monies were used to establish regional Roving Habitat Crews to address needed upland and wetland habitat management work on public lands. We have seen remarkable recoveries of both habitat quality and subsequent wildlife use of wetlands when we have invested in active management. The funding requested in this proposal will be targeted to continuing the wetland habitat work accomplished by the Region 3 Roving Habitat Crew. Work will include, but not be limited to, managing water levels, maintaining fish barriers and other wetland infrastructure, inducing winterkill of fish, and and controlling invasive plants and fish. SHALLOW LAKES / WETLAND PROJECTS -The habitat quality of the shallow lakes/wetlands still on the landscape can be markedly improved by implementing active management to bring about habitat objectives. This proposal seeks to engineer and construct wetland infrastructure such as dikes, water control structures, and fish barriers, and to implement management techniques such as prescribed burns, rough fish control and water level manipulation. The shallow lake and wetland projects identified in this proposal for enhancement were proposed and reviewed by DNR Area and Regional supervisors. Projects, as shown in the accompanying parcel list, include engineering feasibility and design work, replacement/renovation of wetland infrastructure to bring about habitat enhancement, and direct wetland management activities. Aerial cattail spraying is included. Additionally, a capital equipment purchase of a Trimble Survey Unit will be made to staff to evaluate and survey potential projects.

","As some of the only wetland basins that remain in prairie Minnesota, shallow lakes and large wetlands throughout southern and western Minnesota have become degraded due to high, stable water levels, altered natural hydrology due to highly drained and intensively cultivated watersheds, lack of natural fish winterkill, and invasive fish (including carp) that have increased access and overwinter survival due to high, stable water levels and manmade drainage systems through which they can now travel. These factors combined with naturally fertile prairie soils result in turbid water conditions over prolonged periods which reduce aquatic plant and invertebrate abundance upon which wetland wildlife depend in our remaining prairie wetlands and shallow lakes. The result is degraded wetland conditions that do not provide the aquatic food resources wetland-dependent wildlife, especially waterfowl, require as they move through and attempt to breed in Minnesota. The lack of high quality, productive wetland habitat is especially problematic for diving ducks and brood-rearing ducks which are fully dependent on wetlands and shallow lakes for all of their food resources. The huge watershed changes in Minnesota’s agriculture-dominated prairie landscape that are largely beyond the control of conservationists leave agency wildlife managers with few options to improve and protect our remaining public water wetlands and shallow lakes. These tools primarily include acquiring and restoring land around our remaining wetlands and shallow lakes to buffer them from the effects of highly degraded and drained agricultural landscapes, and actively managing water levels in them to periodically induce temporary drought conditions to winterkill fish and rejuvenate the aquatic ecology of aquatic plants and invertebrates in them upon which waterfowl and other wetland-depending migratory birds rely. Through our Living Lakes Initiative, Ducks Unlimited (DU) strives to help Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (Service) to improve and protect our remaining shallow lakes and large wetland marshes. The goal of this Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) grant-funded program was to support DU wetland bio-engineering assistance to help the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service structurally improve shallow lakes outlets by designing and installing new water control structures used to enhance the aquatic habitat quality of wetlands throughout southern and western Minnesota. DU biologists and engineers worked together with Minnesota DNR shallow lake program and area wildlife managers alongside Service biologists to design and construct water control structures with fish barriers that allow managers to enhance water quality and wetland habitat conditions for wildlife through temporary water level draw-downs. DU also protects private shallow lake shoreland on managed shallow lakes by securing a conservation easement held and enforced by DU. In partnership with Minnesota DNR, DU designed and implemented eight shallow lake enhancement projects that improved 6,882 acres through the bio-engineering design and installation of water control structures and pumps equipped with fish barriers features. Minnesota DNR wildlife field staff used these structures to conduct temporary water level draw-downs to simulate natural drought conditions that winterkilled invasive fish (especially carp), consolidated sediments and nutrients, and rejuvenated the aquatic ecology of shallow lakes. These capital investments will last for decades, and will continue to be used periodically by Minnesota DNR wildlife field staff to manage and further enhance shallow lake habitat through annual state duck stamp funding. The shallow lakes enhanced through this grant include 316-acre Jennie Lake in Douglas County, 4,076-acre Lake Christina and Lake Ina complex in Douglas County, 1,166-acre Rice Lake in Faribault County, 218-acre Ash Lake in Grant County, 165-acre Cory Lake on Hamlin WMA in Lac qui Parle County, 171-acre Round Lake on Shetek WMA in Murray County, 330-acre Smith Lake in Wright County, and 440-acre Curtis Lake in Yellow Medicine County. In addition, DU also engineered new water control structures for the Service on Rydell National Wildlife Refuge and for the Minnesota DNR on Malardi state Wildlife Management Area (WMA) that will be installed through future 2010 and 2012 OHF grants to DU after permits and funding have been secured. Finally, DU also secured a purchased conservation easement on Fish Lake in Stearns County that permanently protects 179 acres in perpetuity, which DU will annually monitor and enforce with stewardship endowment funding provided by the landowner.

Overall, DU and DNR completed 26 project affecting 7,603 acres.  These included three wetland restoration projects restoring 97 acres, 18 shallow lake enhancement projects enhancing 7,154 wetland acres, and five fee-title land acquisition projects protecting 352 acres.  DNR also completed 317 shallow lake assessment surveys to document current ecological conditions and help justify future shallow lake enhancement projects, while DU staff worked on 50 new shallow lake engineering enhancement projects to design water control structures for state DNR Wildlife Management Areas (WMA), public waters, and wetlands on federal lands managed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.  Financially, DU and DNR spent $6,439,871 of the $6,505,000 appropriated for this project.  DU spent the entire $5,042,000 portion appropriated to Ducks Unlimited while providing $1,205,381 in non-state financial leverage for a total expense of $6,247,381.  This non-state leverage provided by DU far surpassed the minimal leverage pledged, and was comprised of a combination of private funds donated to DU from individuals, foundations, and corporations, and federal grants such as the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA).  Meanwhile, Minnesota DNR spent $$1,397,871 of the $1,463,000 appropriated to DNR, leaving $65,129 unspent to be returned to the Outdoor Heritage Fund.  Although we fell short of our 750-acre land protection via fee-title acquisition goal, we exceeded all other original accomplishment plan goals of 200 shallow lake assessments, engineering work on 50 new enhancement projects, restoration of 63 wetland acres, and enhancement of 7,132 shallow lake wetland acres. The shortfall in total acres acquired was due to sharply rising cropland prices during this grant period, and uncooperative landowners in the drained Moonshine Lake basin in Big Stone County that made acquisition of those lands not feasible as previously planned.  The primary landowner there refused to sell his land for appraised fair market value, and DU did not anticipate the spike in agricultural land prices that made acquiring an equal number of acres elsewhere impossible.  Nonetheless, DU did acquire five smaller parcels totaling 352 acres in the Prairie Section, including 100 acres of wetlands and 252 acres of uplands.  These parcels have been transferred to the Minnesota DNR for inclusion into the state WMA system for long-term habitat management and public outdoor recreational use.Importantly, DU and DNR wetland projects were highly successful and surpassed our acreage goals.  DU and DNR completed three wetland restoration projects, one by DNR on Pelican Lake WMA in Wright County that restored hydrology to 25 wetland acres in the Metro Section, and two others by DU that involved restoring wetland hydrology to 45 acres on Fenmont WMA in Nobles County and 27 acres o Four Corners WMA in Martin County in the Prairie Section.  Moreover, DU and DNR each completed nine additional shallow lake and wetland enhancement projects that improved wetland ecological condition and management capability, for a total of 18 projects that enhanced 7,154 wetland acres in Prairie, Transition, and Metro Sections.  These were mostly structural enhancement projects where DU and DNR engineering installed water control structures to allow for temporary water level draw-downs to enhance the aquatic ecology of managed wetlands on state and federal areas (including four Waterfowl Production Areas).  Most of the acres enhanced were located on the Roseau state WMA, where DNR renovated an important dike used to control water levels in a large wetland. Elsewhere, DNR seeded wild rice into 40 acres of wetlands and shallow lakes in Wright and Stearns Counties in Metro, Transition, and Prairie Sections.All DU and DNR wetland restoration and shallow lake enhancement projects were in public waters or in basins on state DNR or federal land where DNR or the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service will manage and maintain them for both wildlife habitat and public benefit.  All lands acquired by DU were transferred to the Minnesota DNR for long-term wildlife habitat management and pubic outdoor recreational use.",2010-07-01,2015-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Jon,Schneider,"Ducks Unlimited","311 East Lake Geneva Road",Alexandria,MN,56308,320-762-9916,jschneider@ducks.org,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Anoka, Becker, Benton, Big Stone, Blue Earth, Clearwater, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Freeborn, Kittson, Le Sueur, Lyon, Marshall, Martin, Meeker, Murray, Nobles, Polk, Pope, Roseau, Stearns, Stevens, Wright",,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-shallow-lake-and-wetland-enhancement-and-restoration-program,,,,

These projects were modifications to dams that will allow fish to bypass these former barriers. One fish passage project on Chester Creek planned for this appropriation was not completed due to delays in contracting for construction by our project partner, the city of Duluth. They have been very busy contracting stream projects due to the flood of 2012, and this unexpected development kept us from completing the project on time. A design for the project was paid for with this appropriation. The project will be built in 2016 using flood damage money from the State of Minnesota.An instream habitat project was completed on West Beaver Creek. The project narrowed the stream channel to improve instream habitat and better transport fine sediment. Instream habitat was also enhanced, and bank stability improved to reduce erosion.Riparian habitat was enhanced at fourteen coldwater streams and two warmwater streams. These projects will enhance native prairie plants that will improve bank stability and instream cover. Prairie species also encourage narrow and deep stream channels that better move fine sediment, improving habitat for fish and invertebrates. Habitat practices included brush removal, prescribed burns, control of invasive plants, and planting of native species.Lake riparian habitat was enhanced at nine locations. These projects were done cooperatively through grants to local organizations. Mowed turf grass was replaced with native plants with deep roots that are better at stabilizing the shoreline and provide habitat for species such as frogs and other aquatic animals. These parcels are also open to public fishing.We permanently protected lakeshore habitat at eight locations, covering 276 acres. These parcels will protect intact lake shoreline that has been shown to be critical to fish reproduction, and to preventing shoreland erosion. We also protected one parcel on a trout stream through a conservation easement. This will protect coldwater conditions and habitat in the stream through the preservation of riparian vegetation. This parcel will also be open to public fishing.We fell short of our planned output acreage for this appropriation due to a number of factors. First, our protection acreage can vary depending on the relative amount of upland land that is purchased with adjoining waterfront. Sometimes parcels are a narrow strip of lakeshore, while at other times a parcel may be quite deep and have considerable upland that is purchased. For this appropriation, our acquisitions leaned toward primarily waterfront land resulting in a shortfall of 98 acres. Second, when this accomplishment plan was written we planned to be able to account for benefitted upstream acres for fish passage projects. During a plan amendment for a different appropriation we were given direction by the council that we should only count footprint acres for these types of projects. We did not go back and do plan amendments for other appropriations to reflect this guidance, but did follow that direction in our reporting. As a result we reported 1260 acres less than was planned. Third, our trout stream riparian enhancement work over-estimated the amount that we could complete, resulting in a shortfall of 424 acres. The work for this part of the appropriation was completed during the last 6 months that the money was available, preventing a plan amendment to reflect the change in acreage output. We will know better in the future how to estimate acres for this type of work. The fourth reason for our shortfall was an amendment from a fish passage project on the Mississippi River at Little Falls to a channel restoration project on the Buffalo River. As previously mentioned, when the plan was written we expected to report the full benefitted acreage for the fish passage project. When we amended to plan to spend that money on the Buffalo River, there was no corresponding change to our planned output acres as reflected in table 1. This was not changed mainly because the original version of ML2010 accomplishment plan does not include a “Table 1” as shown in the online version. Instead there are a series of less organized tables that allow for a more narrative description of the work. The resulting shortfall in acres from this change was 564 acres.In total, these differences from the accomplishment plan account for 2346 acres, which would explain the difference between the original plan and what we have reported for output. We have learned several lessons regarding output acres since this early appropriation. We will work hard to have our outputs better match the accomplishment plan in future reporting.",2010-07-01,2015-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,"Brian ",Nerbonne,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources","500 Lafayette Road","St. Paul",MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Aitkin, Becker, Beltrami, Blue Earth, Carver, Cass, Chisago, Cook, Crow Wing, Dakota, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Hennepin, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Jackson, Kandiyohi, Lake, Le Sueur, Martin, Meeker, Morrison, Murray, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Ramsey, Redwood",,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-acquisition,,,,

These projects are good examples of the benefits of OHF. Low diversity grasslands provide some habitat for wildlife. These funds allow us to enhance and improve these habitats, going above and beyond what we could do without these funds. By far our most effective management tool is prescribed fire and we were able to burn over 48,000 acres, just over 75 square miles, with these funds.Our acre estimate is probably a low number, especially for woody removal. Trees in grasslands affect both the immediate area as well as the surrounding area. Generally we remove trees to increase nest success in the surrounding areas. While we may only record one acre of tree removal, we’re enhancing nest success for an entire WMA.This was the fourth appropriation for the DNR's programmatic Grassland Enhancement efforts. The primary focus for the Wildlife Section of this appropriation was the use of two Roving Crews, in Region One (located in Polk County) and Region 3 (located in Dakota County). Roving Crews are self-contained habitat enhancement programs. One hundred percent of their time is dedicated to habitat enhancement. In addition, we worked with local contractors to do additional habitat work on WMAs and SNAs.Division of Ecological and Water Resource staff funded on this appropriation did a variety of tasks, including writing contracts for woody removal projects and prescribed burns, firebreak installation, prescribed burn planning and execution, prairie reconstruction, and smaller invasive removal projects. CCM crews were contracted for many projects to add additional abilities. Specifically noteworthy, southern region EWR hires a CCM crew for several weeks in the spring each year to build support into the DNR burn crew (there would not be enough staff for a crew without CCM).In addition to these data, we also provide the following narratives showing the outputs and outcomes of several of the projects on the parcel list.The Cuka WMA project involved the removal of scattered invasive volunteer trees from 130 acres of native and restored prairie. A DNR survey on June 11, 2013 revealed the presence of at least 508 individual clusters of Small White Lady Slipper orchids. The orchid is abundant on Cuka WMA and this tree removal was management that is a direct positive for the preservation of this species. The removal of predator perches and den trees was one objective that appears to have been successfully met based upon the pheasant production that has been observed on this unit in recent years. One hunter has harvested a 2 bird limit on every pheasant opener for the last four years.A large portion of Benson WMA was already a quality restored grassland and wetland complex when acquired, but had thousands of trees covering the WMA. Without treatment, the site would have soon lost its open nature and grassland wildlife. The site includes a very high quality remnant prairie that we use to harvest local ecotype seed for nearby WMA restorations.Two Rivers Aspen Parkland SNA is a 1400 acre high quality brush prairie that was being invaded by aspen. This transition can be devastating to many wildlife species, particularly sharp tailed grouse as they tend to abandon these areas once they transition. After the prescribed burn and woody removal projects, there was a significant increase in sharp tailed grouse observations.Sweetwater WMA has two tracts totaling 430 acres. These tracts are part of a contiguous complex of public lands, including roughly 1,000 acres of Waterfowl Production Areas and 500 acres of WMA in the heart of Lac qui Parle County – an area with a rich history of waterfowl and upland bird hunting. The tree removal work on Sweetwater WMA compliments ongoing habitat acquisitions, restorations and enhancements being done in this area through partnerships among USFWS, MNDNR, TNC, PF and DU.Cooperative Farming Agreement fields totaling nineteen acres on four WMAs in the south Metro were retired. The fields were planted to a diverse mix native grasses and forbs. This will benefit pollinators as well as providing additional nesting cover. These WMAs are relatively close to the Metro Area, proving both wildlife habitat as well as hunting and other recreational opportunities for Twin Cities residents.Because this is a programmatic appropriation, it’s difficult to assign a dollar amount to a specific project. Because of this and the large number of projects, we simply assigned dollars to projects proportional to acres completed in that project.

Design only projects are surveyed and receive preliminary design plans and support from Minnesota DNR engineers. This initial work is critical to identify project issues, determine realistic cost estimates, and ensure that future construction can proceed with minimal delays. No acres are reported for design-only projects; that occurs only after construction. Eight projects were design-only. Thirteen projects were design and construct. These 13 projects involved the construction or renovation of water control structures, fish barriers and/or dikes. This work enhanced almost 1200 acres, 913 of which were in the Prairie Ecological Section.Roving Habitat Crews - Minnesota DNR Roving Habitat Crews are highly trained, equipped and motivated staff working together to enhance Wildlife Mangement Areas. Begun in 2010, 2 6-person crews were established to work on prairie grasslands, with one crew based in Mentor, MN and one based at Lac Qui Parle. Beginning with this Accelerated Shallow Lakes and Wetland Enhancements, Phase IV, OHF appropriation, funding was provided to the 2 crews to allow to them expand to do wetland enhancement work. Each crew was provided 2 additional staff and they were able to spend 25% of their time and resources on wetland and shallow lake activities. This work included wetland prescribed burns, removal of woody vegetation from wetlands, the ability to work on wetland drawdowns, cattail spraying and mowing, and other wetland activities. The wetland acreage impacted by these crews has exceeded expectations, with 8,900 wetland acres enhanced. Three thousand-four hundred of these acres were enhanced in the Prairie Ecological Section. The most wetland acres were enhanced in Forest/Prairie Ecological Section, which is a function of the large habitat blocks that are available to manage in northwest Minnesota.Shallow Lakes Program - The Minnesota DNR Shallow Lakes Program consists of a supervisor and 8 shallow lakes specialists. Three of these shallow lake specialist positions were created and funded with the Accelerated Shallow Lakes and Wetland Enhancements, Phase IV, OHF appropriation. Interns are used to augment shallow lake assessment work done during the summer field season. The Shallow Lakes Program can be described as having two major goals - assessment of shallow lakes through a standardized set of measures and initiating management of shallow lakes to enhance their value to wildlife. Management actions may include drawdowns, removal of unwanted fish, control of invasive species, and placement of major infrastructure. Acres are not reported for this component of the grant, though the work done by the Shallow Lakes Program is critical to acres subsequently reported by the DNR or Ducks Unlimited when OHF funds are used to implement management. A measure of the work accomplished by OHF-funded shallow lakes specialists is the number of number of shallow lake assessments the undertake during the grant period.

",,"Final Report: http://www.lsohc.leg.mn/FY2012/accomp_plan/5a.pdf Protection of streams through conservation easements was enabled by the hiring of two easement specialists to work on acquisition. One position was funded through OHF, while the other leveraged funds from a Great Lakes Restoration grant. These positions contacted riparian landowners in targeted locations we prioritized for additional easement protection. We chose to target streams with high-quality habitat and fish populations, and along those streams we prioritized parcels that were adjacent to existing easements or protected public land, as well as landowners who owned parcels with longer lengths of stream. We also prioritized parcels with important features such as springs that are important to maintaining the cold water required by trout. All easements also needed to be accessible to the angling public, either from a public road, adjacent easement, or access path. Contacts with landowners were very fruitful; we found more potential parcels that we had money available for easements. This allowed us to prioritize the best parcels for easement purchase based on our criteria, but also created a list of potential parcels for acquisition using other funding sources, including OHF rounds from future years. We protected a total of 21.3 miles of trout streams using easements. One lakeshore parcel was also protected via conservation easement using this appropriation. The landowners (a scout camp) wanted the parcel protected, but also wanted to continue their passive use of the parcel. A conservation easement was a better tool than fee title acquisition in this case, which allowed us to protect 200 acres along 1.3 miles of lakeshore. The total amount of lake and stream shore acres protected by easements was just short of our goal (585 vs. 609), but we believe in the case of lake and stream riparian protection the length of shoreline is the more important measure. Fee title acquisition protected a total of 7.4 miles of lakeshore (504 acres) under this appropriation. We selected parcels for acquisition where the ratio of lakeshore to total acres was high in order to maximize riparian area protected, and where we protected critical and sensitive habitat such as emergent vegetation and natural shorelines that are critical for aquatic fish and wildlife. We were able to exceed our goal for acres protected in fee (504 vs. 427), in part due to over $550,000 in landowner donations of value that leveraged OHF money. We completed four stream habitat projects: two were on trout streams (Eagle and Rush Creeks), and two were on a warmwater rivers (Buffalo and Pomme de Terre Rivers). Eagle Creek had been degraded by years of cattle grazing, along with numerous beaver dams that had created a wide, shallow stream uninhabited by trout, unlike downstream reaches with better habitat. Using a combination of coir logs, rootwads and other woody debris, and grading and revegetating of the streambanks, the stream was narrowed to less than half of its former width. This created a much deeper stream channel with better habitat for fish, as well as the ability for the stream to better move the over-abundance of sand that comprised the stream bottom. Trout are now found in the restored half-mile of stream. The local watershed district contributed matching funds that helped to complete the project. Rush Creek habitat work has enhanced 2.5 miles of this trout stream. Steep eroding banks have been graded back, creating a floodplain that reduces the erosive energy of the stream during high water. Habitat structures of wood and rock have been placed in strategic locations on outside bends, providing stability to streambanks as well as cover for fish. All riparian areas have been seeded with a native mix of deep-rooted prairie grasses and forbs, providing enhanced stability for streambanks and habitat for terrestrial wildlife. Restoration of a reach of the Buffalo River was done on property owned by the City of Hawley. A formerly straightened reach of the river, the stream had eroding banks and lacked diverse depths, velocities, and cover required by most fish species. 2,700 feet of new meandering stream channel was constructed to restore the stream to a more natural condition, and outside bends were stabilized with woody material buried into the banks which not only provides stability while planted native vegetation becomes established, but also provides habitat for fish and aquatic insects. Enhancement work on the Pomme de Terre River was done on a relatively small area, but was critical to habitat in that reach. Due to bank erosion, the stream was in the process of cutting around a riffle that controls the grade of the streambed in that reach. That could have eventually lead to a downcutting of the stream channel that would have sent tons of sediment downstream. Instead, the streambank was stabilized using rootwads, and additional gravel and cobbles were added to the riffle to enhance its stability, as well as local habitat.",2011-07-20,2016-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Brian,Nerbonne,DNR,"500 Lafayette Road","St. Paul",MN,55155,651-259-5205,brian.nerbonne@state.mn.us,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Becker, Beltrami, Benton, Blue Earth, Cass, Chisago, Clay, Cook, Cottonwood, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Houston, Hubbard, Itasca, Kandiyohi, Lake, Morrison, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Redwood, Rice, Scott, St. Louis, Swift, Wabasha, Winona","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-aquatic-management-area-habitat-program-phase-3,,,,

The parcel list changed substantially from the time of the request as the project went on because of several factors, including: 1) one of the core strengths of the Roving Crew is their flexibility to move quickly on a priority habitat enhancement opportunity, and this often meant addressing parcels that met the appropriation’s purpose, but not on the parcel list; 2) given the nature and purpose of the Roving Crew, parcels/projects done by them were not on the original list, but were added upon completion; and 3) site condition and weather help determine whether we can work on a given project on a given day, and we do our best to find alternate parcels of similar value/priority, even if not on the original parcel list, to maximize efficiency.  Especially when it comes to weather issues (usually ‘too wet’), often large areas affected.  The flexibility of the Roving Crew allowed them to do same enhancement work, but on WMAs in nearby counties not as affected by the weather. For all these reasons, we added a number of sites in counties not originally included in the parcel list.  Although it can make reporting challenging, we feel this dynamic flexibility is one of the strengths of our Roving Crews and our contracting process.  While many appropriations highlight specific projects, “what” they did, we feel the strength of this appropriation is in the cumulative effect of many small projects and “how” we did it.  Specifically, we did a lot of this work by developing the Region 4 (Southern) DNR Roving Crew.  This crew is located at Lac Qui Parle.  As part of developing a new crew, office and shop space had to be developed, crews hired, and those crews needed to be equipped.  That was followed by a steep learning curve as the crew coalesced and began working on projects.  These crews only do habitat work.  We try to minimize the time spent with paperwork, office work, budgets, etc, so that they can fully devote their time to ‘boots on the ground’ habitat enhancement projects.  At the same time, there were some inclement weather patterns during these years that limited the activities of the crews during some periods.  Even given those unavoidable issues, the appropriation exceeded its target acres.  It is our assessment that these initial years are the slowest and therefore least productive.  This crew, as well as the other two, are all functioning as highly efficient teams.  The rest of the work was done with contractors, which stimulates local rural economies.  According to the research literature, we actually underestimating the acres enhanced, especially as it relates to woody removal projects.  Numerous studies show it’s not just the area ‘under the trees’ that impact grassland birds, but the area around the woody vegetation.  Some species simply won’t nest near woody cover and other studies show high nest predation (gamebird) or brood parasitism (songbirds) rates near woody cover.  By removing even a few trees from the center of a grassland, we are actually enhancing the entire area.  Snyder (1984) found that pheasant nest success double greater than 600 meters from a tree.  That means for every tree, or clump of trees, removed we are effectively enhancing nesting success in the surrounding 280 acres of grassland.Although this appropriation focused on the Roving Crew, we can highlight a couple projects as small examples of all the work that we are proud of.  Glenflur WMA – Cottonwood County.  This 165 acre tree removal project substantially opened up this tract.  This WMA is part of the Cottonwood River Prairie Core Area and contains areas of unbroken prairie.  This site had not experienced significance disturbance, other than heavy grazing, in several decades.  A lack of disturbance had allowed tree succession to begin to invade. Prairie Bush Clover and Loggerhead Shrike are SGCN noted in this area.Lac qui Parle WMA-Nygard Tract – Swift County.  This tract is part of the larger Chippewa Prairie on the Lac qui Parle WMA and is part of a Prairie Plan Core Area.  This remnant prairie had been moderately grazed and had not seen disturbance by fire in decades.  Woody encroachment was beginning to take hold prior to this project.  Through a combination of tree removal, prescribed burning and grazing this site is now in good condition with sightings of several native prairie species that were suppressed due to lack of disturbance from fire.  This area has recent sightings of Marbled Godwits, Slender Milk Vetch, Loggerhead Shrike and Upland Sandpipers.The SNA Program was able to start a series of contracted woody removal projects at Swede’s Forest SNA.  Swede’s Forest is home to a large population of the rare five-lined skink.  The management being completed here is focused on removal of encroaching red cedar and invasive buckthorn, improving habitat not only for the five-lined skink but also for the multiple other wildlife species that call this site home.Additionally, SNA staff, with support of CCM, were able to conduct a 109 acre prescribed burn at Prairie Coteau SNA.  Prairie Coteau SNA is one of the most important and stunning prairies in southwestern Minnesota.  This prescribed burn helped improve habitat for grassland gamebird species found on the site in addition to the rare non-game species.It was difficult to assign an exact dollar figure to each person and each project.  What I did was take the total personnel budget, identify the ratio of FTE/years, and scale the personnel budget to that ratio.  I used the same approach on the parcel list.  I took the total budget and total acres, identified percentage of acres for each project relative to the acre total, and assigned the ratio of funds to that project. ",2011-07-01,2016-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Greg,Hoch,"MN DNR","500 Lafayette Rd","St. Paul",MN,55155,651-259-5230,greg.hoch@state.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Anoka, Benton, Big Stone, Blue Earth, Brown, Carver, Chippewa, Clay, Cottonwood, Dodge, Faribault, Fillmore, Freeborn, Goodhue, Houston, Isanti, Jackson, Kanabec, Kandiyohi, Lac qui Parle, Lincoln, Lyon, Martin, McLeod, Meeker, Morrison, Mower, Murray, Nicollet, Nobles, Norman, Otter Tail, Pipestone, Redwood, Renville, Sherburne, Sibley, Stearns, Swift, Todd, Wabasha, Wadena, Washington, Watonwan, Winona, Wright, Yellow Medicine","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/accelerated-prairie-restoration-and-enhancement-dnr-lands-phase-3,,,,

These projects will address work called for in the Minnesota Prairie Conservation Plan, Long Range Duck Recovery Plan, and Shallow Lakes plan.","Approximately 30 species of waterfowl are regular migrants through Minnesota. More than a dozen breed and nest in Minnesota. While each of these species has its own particular habitat needs the common bond is a dependence on wetland habitat for survival. Meeting the needs of these waterfowl requires a complex of wetland sizes and types ranging from temporary and seasonal wetlands to large permanent shallow lakes. Minnesota’s breeding waterfowl go through five life stages in our state: Breeding, Nesting, Brood Rearing, Molting, and Migration. Each life stage has its own characteristic habitat needs. For example, for most species, especially dabbling ducks, the number of breeding pairs in the spring is driven by the number of small wetlands. The small size helps reduce disturbance by other ducks and the abundant wetland invertebrates they provide are critical to providing the fat, protein, and calcium needed by hens as they prepare for egg laying.Nesting dabbling duck hens and some diver species require adequate upland cover for actual nesting but are dependent on nearby wetlands for continuing nutrition throughout the egg laying and incubation period. High quality shallow lakes and wetlands fill this need. Seasonal wetlands are particularly critical for dabbling ducks. Over water nesting species depend on wetlands and shallow lakes with a good interspersion of emergent vegetation for nesting sites and nesting material. Food is critical for the survival of growing ducklings and molting hens. Seasonal wetlands fill this critical role during wet years while semi-permanent wetlands and shallow lakes increase in importance as the summer progresses. Regardless of the wetland type, poor plant and invertebrate quality due to invasive fish and nutrient loading can negate the expected benefits. Food and protection from disturbance are the critical elements needed to attract and hold waterfowl during fall migration. Wetland quality and depth are critical drivers of wetland based food resources. Large basins provide more inherent protection from disturbance although wetland and shallow lake based refuges are very important. High quality shallow lakes and wetlands have clear water and abundant rooted aquatic vegetation. Emergent aquatic plants such as rushes and wild rice provide protective cover from weather and predators as well as overwater nesting habitat. Submergent aquatic plants provide food in the form of seeds and tubers and critical habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Very shallow seasonal wetlands can be critical sources of invertebrates and nutritious plant seeds during spring, early summer and fall, particularly for dabbling ducks.And it goes without saying that Minnesota wetlands, besides being invaluable for waterfowl, also provide other desirable functions and values - habitat for a wide range of species, groundwater recharge, water purification, flood water storage, shoreline protection, and economic benefits.An estimated 90% of Minnesota’s prairie wetlands have been lost, more than 50% of our statewide wetland resource. Throughout the state, remaining shallow lakes and wetlands provide the aforementioned critical habitat for each life stage of waterfowl and other wetland wildlife. Unfortunately these benefits are too often compromised by degraded habitat quality due to excessive runoff and invasive plants and fish. Additionally, wetlands continue to be lost or degraded by ongoing ditching and tiling from agriculture and other forces. In our remaining wetland habitat, only about one prairie wetland in five exhibits good quality vegetation while just under a third provide good habitat for invertebrates. While wetlands in the forest-prairie transition fare better with a little fewer than half providing good habitat for invertebrates, they actually do a bit worse for aquatic plants due to invasive species.The habitat quality of the shallow lakes and wetlands still on the landscape can be markedly improved by controlling invasive species and rough fish, and installing fish barriers where needed and aggressively managing water levels to meet management objectives. This proposal seeks to implement engineering design of dikes, water control structures, and fish barriers (Design), installing the of design elements (Construction), and intensifying the application of management techniques such as invasive species control, water level manipulation, and wild rice seeding (Intensive Management). Additionally, the proposal seeks to continue the the successful model of regional roving habitat crews to address the growing backlog of wetland habitat management on Wildlife Management Areas. The shallow lakes and wetlands identified in this proposal for enhancement were proposed and ranked by DNR Area Wildlife Supervisors through their respective Regional Wildlife Managers. The proposals were reviewed by the Wetland Wildlife Program Consultant and the Wildlife Operations Manager prior to inclusion in this proposal.Five construction projects on wetland and shallow lake basins have been identified to upgrade or replace wetland habitat infrastructure. Three projects will be designed with funding from this proposal to prepare for future construction. One project will be undertaken to manage dense monotypic stands of cattails that are negatively impacting the value of wetlands for wildlife habitat. One project will be undertaken to draw down a shallow lake and apply piscicide to remove rough fish. Roving habitat crews will accomplish wetland habitat work that will include, but not be limited to, managing water levels, maintaining fish barriers, inducing winterkill of fish, controlling invasive plants and fish, and encouraging native plant assemblages. Program managers may add, delete, and substitute projects on the approved parcel list based upon need, readiness, cost, opportunity, and/or urgency so long as the substitute parcel/project forwards the constitutional objectives of this program in the Project Scope table of this accomplishment plan.

Over 1.3 million acres of habitat in over 1,400 WMAs are protected by the DNR. Restoration and enhancement of habitat on WMA's are core management principles. These networks provide diverse year-round food and cover for local wildlife, as well as resources for migratory wildlife. The Minnesota Prairie Conservation Plan stresses strategic habitat complexes that provide multiple benefits including water quality improvements, seed sources and local economic diversity. Minnesota's Scientific and Natural Area program, created by the 1969 Minnesota Legislature, currently administers over 140 natural areas and 100 Native Prairie Bank easements. Most restoration and enhancement practices being applied with this proposal have been proven to provide desired outcomes on existing state-managed lands. Through this funding, the state will be able to accelerate restoration and enhancement habitat improvements on state land and lands protected by permanent easement thereby providing for improved critical wildlife habitat and a more functional prairie landscape. Habitat improvement actions enhance existing degraded habitat to directly increase the productivity of nesting habitat for pheasants, waterfowl and a variety of non-game grassland species such as meadowlarks, longspurs, Species of Greatest Conservation Need and a suite of critical pollinator species. Although Minnesota DNR has the training and know-how to restore high quality prairie vegetation current funding has been insufficient to meet all needs. Many sites on state lands are currently not being actively managed to full potential. Furthermore exotic and/or invasive plants are encroaching into them. Woody cover encroachment is an especially troublesome problem. Enhancement and restoration of prairie requires periodic disturbance such as prescribed burning, conservation grazing, haying, inter-seeding grasslands with native species, and up to five years post-seeding management. Harvesting and using high quality seed from established prairie sites to plant at other locations has proven to be highly cost-effective. WMA Habitat Work (approximately 5,260 acres over 5 years) – Total $1,606,972Grassland restoration and enhancement work will be through techniques such as brush and tree removal, bareground seeding, grassland conversion, chemical treatment, mowing, inter-seeding, and burning. Seed will be obtained via harvesting of local native or restored prairie when possible and purchase of seed from vendors when necessary (following Operational Order 124). DNR will contract much of this work. Seed mixes used for prairie restoration and enhancement will be adequately diverse to provide pollinator habitat throughout the growing season. All other work will be done using Best Management Practices to ensure pollinator habitat consistent with MN Statute 84.973. Ecological and Water Resources Habitat Work (approximately 3,190 acres over 5 years) – Total $887,000Restoration of prairie will occur on 35 acres of severely altered lands by reconstructing native plant communities. These restorations are either in-holdings within a native prairie, or lands surrounding a native prairie. Seed will be collected from native prairies adjacent to the restorations or purchased from vendors with local seed sources. Seed mixes will be adequately diverse to provide pollinator habitat throughout the growing season. These restorations will expand existing prairie habitat and buffer native prairies from the impacts of adjacent land uses. Funding requested for restoration projects will cover all costs and activities associated with reconstructing a prairie including project design, seedbed preparation, seed harvest, seed installation, and first year weed control. Prairie enhancement activities will be implemented on 3155 acres of existing SNA's, State Forest Land and Prairie Bank Easement sites. Funding requested for enhancement projects will cover all project costs and activities including project design, contract administration, staff time, equipment and supplies. These enhancement activities will focus on native prairies, but may include some restored prairies within the project sites. Many of these native prairie sites harbor rare and unique features, or are located on steep terrain, which require low impact management techniques (e.g. hand cutting of woody encroachment). These specialized prairie management techniques, and the skilled crews that implement them, can incur higher costs than similar lower diversity grassland projects.WMA Roving Crews (approximately 20,500 acres over 2 years) - $2,024,728WMA Roving Crews have proven to be an effective means to accomplish supplemental habitat work.

Five wetland/shallow lake infrastructure projects were designed and completed (Carlos Avery WMA, Anoka County; Joe River WMA, Kittson County; Cornish Flowage, Aitkin County; Mille Lacs WMA, Mille Lacs County; and Dry Sand WMA, Cass County).  These projects improved or replaced dikes and water level control structures.  These projects enhanced 3,079 acres of wetland habitat.  In addition to these design and construct projects, another four projects were design only.  Because of the complexity of many shallow lake and wetland infrastructure projects, we sometimes begin by bringing in engineers to survey and design potential projects.  We can use this initial information to develop cost estimates, obtain permits, and determine if and when to move ahead with construction.  Because design-only projects do not entail construction, no acres are claimed for these projects, as is consistent with our past reports. These four design-only projects were at Spohn WMA, Quistorff WMA, Aurzada WMA, and Ruff-Nik WMA, all in Todd County. 6,068 acres of invasive cattails were sprayed statewide.  This work was done in both 2015 and 2018.  The work in 2015 was done using private contractors, but in 2018 we were able to do the work using a state-owned helicopter outfitted with an OHF-funded spray unit and using the OHF-funded Roving Habitat Crews as ground support personnel. The acreage of cattails sprayed includes 13.3 acres of a new invasive grass that was discovered at McCarthy Lake WMA.  We were able to effectively deal with this potential threat thanks to the equipment and personnel we now have available.  While aerial spraying of monotypic stands of cattails can't resolve the problem statewide due to the extent of their coverage, property managers are excited to have aerial spraying as a means to improve wetland habitat at select sites.   Finally, a major prescribed wetland burn was funded out of this appropriation which enhanced 10,200 acres.  This was one of the largest prescribed burns ever done in Minnesota.  The effectiveness of this burn and it's relatively low cost have property managers considering future large wetland burns. In total, 19,365 wetland acres were enhanced by this appropriation, well above the Accomplishment Plan goal.

The AgBMP loan program provides 3% loans through local lenders to farmers, rural landowners, and agriculture supply businesses. Funds are used for proven practices that prevent non-point source water pollution or solve existing water quality problems. The program provides low interest financing for capital improvements that improve water quality through: Feedlot Improvements, Conservation Tillage Equipment, Septic System Replacements / Upgrades, Erosion Control Structures, Shoreline Stabilization,  and Wetland Restoration. This program helps landowners purchase equipment that results in less erosion and/or runoff to rivers and streams. It helps landowners fix septic systems that are discharging to surface or groundwater. It provides funds to seal old wells and relocate new wells in areas that are less environmentally sensitive. It helps landowners fix and stabilize gullies, waterways, shorelines, and riverbanks. Any practice that solves a water quality problem is eligible! There are many great attributes of the AgBMP Loan program: Loans support local implementation of conservation practices, Loans fund proven practices that improve water quality, Loans can be used with cost share programs and funds are available statewide, The cost to the state is very low, averaging less than $200 per loan in administrative costs, The AgBMP loan program is a revolving fund, money is used, repaid and used again and again to provide a perpetual funding source for continued financing of more projects to support conservation. This program bases the eligibility of practices on recommendations of the University of Minnesota, MPCA, Minnesota Department of Agriculture, United States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (USDA NRCS), and the knowledge and skills of local government unit staff including the county Environmental Office, county feedlot officers, local water planners, local soil and water conservation districts, and consulting engineers. ","The Minnesota Department of Agriculture provides loans to local lenders. The lender is the fiscal agent, they are responsible to disburse the loans, service the loans, collect repayments, and guarantee those repayments back to the program. A soil and water conservation district (SWCD) or County Environmental Office is the local administering agency (see image under Media).Since the MDA provides only loans and the loans are fully guaranteed and always repaid, all funds provided by the AgBMP Loan Program are considered leverage. Ultimately, there are no state funds in an AgBMP loan. The AgBMP loan program does not offer grants; the assistance is in the form of a loan that must be repaid and the repayments are then reused again and again to provide a perpetual funding source for continued financing of more projects. This is referred to as a revolving loan account structure. ","As of 6/30/2019 the AgBMP Loan Program used Clean Water Fund dollars to support 1,354 loans totaling an amount of $23,235,024.

",,,,,,,,"Grass Lake Watershed Management Organization","Local/Regional Government","At 410 acres, Lake Owasso is the largest lake in the Grass Lake Water Management Organization (GLWMO) and one of the most pristine. Maintaining the lakes water quality is a priority for the GLWMO. A long urbanized area along Aladdin Street in Roseville currently lacks stormwater features to remove pollutants and reduce water volume. The rainwater from this area drains directly to a wetland which is hydrologically connected to Lake Owasso. Adjacent to the residential area is a 0.5 acre parking lot which drains into a ditch which eventually enters the same wetland. The rainwater that runoffs from the parking lot also lacks treatment facilities, and due to an extreme change in grade, is causing major erosion problems. In a cooperative effort, the Grass Lake Watershed Management Organization, Ramsey Conservation District and City of Roseville came up with a solution. The parking lot runoff will be re-routed so it enters the adjacent residential stormwater conveyance system. A bio-infiltration basin will then be installed to capture and treat the combined rainwater runoff from both sites. This bioinfiltration basin will annually remove an estimated 864 lbs of sediment, 2.5 lbs of phosphorous, and 10.88 lbs of nitrogen, which would have otherwise entered the wetland.

",,,,,,,,,,"Shell Rock River Watershed District","Local/Regional Government","The Albert Lea Lake Management project replaced the previous Albert Lea Lake fix-crest dam with a 3-in-1 structure that included a rock riffle dam, a lake level management structure, and an electric fish barrier. The benefits from this project include improved aquatic and waterfowl habitat, invasive species management, and improved desirable fish populations.","The Shell Rock River Watershed District (SRRWD) encompasses 246-square miles in Freeborn County. The District includes 11 lakes that drain to the Shell Rock River, which flows into the Cedar River. Among the District’s lakes are Fountain Lake and Albert Lea Lake, located within the City of Albert Lea. These lakes are central to Albert Lea’s tourism industry and its identity.The previous Albert Lea Lake outlet structure and access bridge, installed in 1922, was in need of repair. The Albert Lea Lake Management and Invasive Species Control Project replaced the fixed-crest dam with a rock-arch rapids feature to control water levels. A lake level management structure was also constructed, as well as an electric fish barrier to prevent silver, bighead, and common carp and other benthic feeding fish from entering the lake.The project is expected to result in improved aquatic habitat, improved waterfowl nesting, breeding, and feeding habitat, an increase in desirable fish populations, and improved water quality and clarity for years to come. Specific benefits are outlined below.1. Rock-Arch Water-Level Control: The SRRWD replaced the old fixed-crest dam with a series of rock arches to provide a naturalized outlet to Albert Lea Lake. The upper-most rock arch is controlling the normal water level with the help of metal sheeting. There are two more rock arches behind the first, totaling 3 rock arches. 2.  Lake Level Management Structure: The installation of the structure to facilitate lake-level management gives the SRRWD flexibility to take action benefiting the health of the lake. Periodic lowering of lake elevations allows maximum in-lake sediment compaction, improvement of water clarity due to reduction in wind-generated turbidity, and time for plant colonization of shoreline and shallow-water areas. The resulting improvement in aquatic plant health benefits the entire lake system.3.  Electric fish barrier:  An electric fish barrier was installed and is used to reduce the population of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Albert Lea Lake and to prevent the introduction of Bighead and Silver (Asian) Carp. Common carp uproot and consume aquatic vegetation, disturb and re-suspend phosphorous-rich sediments. The resulting increase in turbidity reduces light penetration—discouraging rooted plant growth—and contributes to algal blooms responsible for oxygen depletion. The destruction of aquatic vegetation by large populations of foraging fish also impacts waterfowl nesting, breeding, and feeding habitat, shoreline and littoral habitat, and game fish spawning habitat.Design and engineering of the project started in late 2013. Contracts and associated agreements for the dam were made in early 2014. The order of operations for the construction of the project includes:•    Installation of the cofferdam•    Construction of the water diversion channel•    Removal of the old dam and bridge•    Installation of the metal sheeting that holds the lake level•    Placement of the first rock arch along the sheeting•    Installation of the footings for the concrete work•    Concrete work for the fish barrier•    Concrete work for the draw down structure•    Finalize/seal all concrete•    Placement of remaining rock arches•    Removal of the cofferdam and water diversion channel•    Installation and fine tuning of the fish barrier componentThe main construction of the projects where completed in the spring of 2015. At the end of 2015, some calibrations of the electric components were needed on the electric fish barrier. After the ice melt in the spring of 2016, those changes were made to fine tune the barrier. The Albert Lea Lake Management and Invasive Species Control Structure is now fully complete. The outlet, fish passage, and fish barrier worked in harmonization as part of the District’s overall management plan. Similar to the Wedge Creek, White Lake, and Mud Lake efforts, the anticipated outcome for Albert Lea Lake is restoration of rooted aquatic vegetation, fish and wildlife habitat, and enhanced water quality—all of which will serve to increase community use of this important recreational resource.   The existing Albert Lea Lake outlet structure and access bridge, installed in 1922, are in need of repair.The proposed project would replace the fixed-crest dam with a rock-arch rapids feature to control water levels and allow fish passage (see concept drawing). A lake level management structure would also be constructed, as well as an electric barrier to prevent silver, bighead, and common carp and other benthic feeding fish from entering the lake. This project is expected to result in improved aquatic habitat, improved waterfowl nesting, breeding, and feeding habitat, an increase in desirable fish populations, and improved water quality and clarity. It has been identified as a high priority in the SRRWD Management Plan, developed with public participation, and subject to public review and approval by the SRRWD Board. Specific benefits are outlined below. 1.  Rock-Arch Water-Level Control and Fish Passage: Replacing the existing fixed-crest dam with a series of rock arches will provide a naturalized outlet to Albert Lea Lake, with the upper-most rock arch controlling the normal water level. The arches will also provide fish passage, allowing northern pike to move upstream from the Shell Rock River to spawn in the lake. Northern Pike typically spawn in March and April, while carp spawning/movement typically does not start until May. A fish passage—in combination with an electric fish barrier activated in May to preclude carp—will increase the population of Northern Pike, natural predators of carp. Albert Lea Lake populations of Northern Pike and Bluegill (also a carp egg predator) are currently below Minnesota DNR norms for similar lakes. 2.  Lake Level Management Structure: Installation of a structure to facilitate lake-level management gives the SRRWD flexibility to take action benefiting the health of the lake. Periodic lowering of lake elevations allows maximum in-lake sediment compaction, improvement of water clarity due to reduction in wind-generated turbidity, and time for plant colonization of shoreline and shallow-water areas. The resulting improvement in aquatic plant health benefits the entire lake system. 3.  Electric fish barrier: An electric fish barrier will be used to reduce the population of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in Albert Lea Lake and to prevent the introduction of Bighead and Silver (Asian) Carp. Common carp uproot and consume aquatic vegetation, disturb and re-suspend phosphorous-rich sediments. The resulting increase in turbidity reduces light penetration—discouraging rooted plant growth—and contributes to algal blooms responsible for oxygen depletion. The destruction of aquatic vegetation by large populations of foraging fish also impacts waterfowl nesting, breeding, and feeding habitat, shoreline and littoral habitat, and game fish spawning habitat. Asian Carp multiply rapidly and are voracious eaters, depleting food resources. The leaping ability of the Silver Carp also poses a danger to boaters and skiers. According to a 2010 news story in the Cedar Rapids Gazette, Asian carp have migrated past the 5-in-1 Dam in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, moving up the Cedar River to Black Hawk County—where the Cedar and the Shell Rock River join. The distance from this point to Albert Lea Lake is only about 100 miles. While there is not general agreement about the threat posed by Asian carp in lake waters, if this does become a concern the barrier could be used year-round and an alternative fish management plan developed. The SRRWD has a proven track record of success with fish barriers. The fish barriers upstream of Albert Lea Lake—at Wedge Creek and White Lake (partially funded by 2009 Outdoor Heritage Funds) and Mud Lake—have improved habitat and water clarity in the upstream areas. Improved habitat is demonstrated by increased sightings of aquatic fur bearers and waterfowl, with 15 waterfowl species sighted during the fall migration. Improvements in water clarity are demonstrated by secchi disk readings on Fountain Lake (connected to these water bodies), which were the best on record in 2010. The proposed outlet, fish passage, and fish barrier will work as part of the District’s overall management plan. Similar to the Wedge Creek, White Lake, and Mud Lake efforts, the anticipated outcome for Albert Lea Lake is restoration of rooted aquatic vegetation, fish and wildlife habitat, and enhanced water quality—all of which will serve to increase community use of this important recreational resource. The strategy of carp/rough fish control and exclusion is known to be effective. This program is endorsed by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Fishery and Wildlife Divisions and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and conducted with their technical assistance and cooperation. This project is consistent with recommendations of the 2004 Shell Rock River Watershed Management Plan (Appendix B & J). It is also noted in the Albert Lea Lake Management Plan, as part of the Freeborn County Comprehensive Water Plan 2006-2015. Other applicable plans include the Minnesota Conservation and Preservation Plan Phase II provisions that address the control of invasive species, restoration of shallow lakes, water quality improvements in impaired waters, and  protection and enhancement of fish and waterfowl breeding habitat (pg. 30-96); and the 2009 Minnesota State Management Plan for Invasive Species. Activities are also within the goals of the Basin Alliance for the Lower Mississippi in Minnesota (BALMM). This project is a component of the 2011 Restoring Native Habitat/Water Quality to the Shell Rock River Project funded by the Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Fund for the fee-title acquisition of the headwaters of the Shell Rock River. The land has been acquired and will be turned over to the DNR to be operated under an Aquatic Management Area Management Plan. There are no known opponents or anticipated barriers to project completion.

Native habitats have become rare and continue to be lost. Oak savanna and prairie - the characteristic habitat of the Anoka Sandplain - now persist over <1% of their historic range. Due to its proximity to the Twin Cities, the ASP is realizing immense development pressure on what native habitat remains. 2. Degradation of habitats on public lands and waters threatens associated wildlife populations. Reduction in habitat quality has had profound impacts on wildlife in the ASP. Minnesota’s CWCP identifies maintenance, enhancement and protection of oak savannas as its first priority in addressing the 97 Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN) occurring in this ecological subsection. 3. Government agencies often lack sufficient resources/capacity to manage important lands. Inadequate funding/capacity for restoration activities on public lands has resulted in declines in the condition of Minnesota’s most important wildlife habitats.

Big Rice Lake has serious, but fixable issues. The proposed work for this lake will reestablish wild rice in a large, historically important wild rice lake. Success of the project will be readily apparent based on one measure - does wild rice become abundant in the project area. DNR and tribal biologists will monitor Big Rice Lake to evaluate wild rice abundance over time..",,,,,791000,54000,,2,DNR,"State Government","Wild rice abundance has greatly declined across Big Rice Lake, while other competitive vegetation has drastically increased. This proposal will utilize knowledge gained from small-scale vegetation work as well as hydrological alterations and apply it to a lake-wide scale to enhance conditions for wild rice success. A total of 2,072 acres of wild rice habitat will be enhanced as a result of the OHF lake outlet work that will impact water levels. 850 acres of the existing 1,000 pickerel weed will be treated to allow wild rice to regenerate.","Big Rice Lake historically was one of the best producing wild rice lakes in northeastern Minnesota for wild rice harvesters and migratory waterfowl use. Today, due to hydrologic alterations, stabilization of water level, and other variables, like changes in climatic conditions and impacts from wildlife herbivory, wild rice has declined across the lake and pickerelweed has become the dominant vegetation. This proposal will accomplish 2,072 acres of wild rice habitat enhancement work on Big Rice Lake. A multi-agency effort will assist in the completion of the project and long-term success. The agencies involved include the US Forest Service, 1854 Treaty Authority, Bois Forte Band of Chippewa, Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, and the Minnesota DNR Wildlife and Shallow Lakes Program. In addition to these key players, Big Rice Lake has a large recreational user group and concerned citizen following. Due to the extent of the issue and importance of the enhancement to all entities involved, it is critical that this project be completed as soon as possible. The project will include three sections to address issues of concern. One section will address the outlet control structure that is inefficient and impacting hydrology. The structure is a rock weir which will be removed and the outlet will be restored to the pre-weir conditions to promote natural flow dynamics. The second section will address the public access to ensure large equipment can be launched. The third section will address the pickerelweed dominance and enhance wild rice abundance. Pickerelweed will be reduced by utilizing a combination of Fond du Lac Band’s airboats and harvester barge, Bois Forte Band’s harvester barge, and a DNR airboat and boat with a mudmotor. Once pickerelweed is removed, wild rice will be more likely to re-establish. If wild rice does not re-establish naturally from the resident seed in the substrate, seed from another location will be evaluated and used to reseed Big Rice Lake. 850 acres of the current 1000-acre area of pickerel weed infestation will be removed.The equipment needs will be essential to the long-term success since this project, specifically vegetation control, is predicted to require some small-scale maintenance until pickerelweed is no longer the dominant species. Based on small-scale vegetation work already completed at Big Rice Lake and the information gathered from sources that have completed similar vegetation enhancement projects, there is a high level of confidence that this project will be successful and will enhance 2,072 acres of wild rice habitat for waterfowl, as well as the recreational users, wild rice harvesters, and waterfowl hunters.",,2019-07-01,,"Outdoor Heritage Fund","In Progress",,,Ricky,Lien,"Minnesota DNR","500 Lafayette Road ","St. Paul",MN,55155,"(651) 259-5227",ricky.lien@state.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"St. Louis","Northern Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/big-rice-lake-wild-rice-enhancement,,,,

In the first phase of this multi-phase project, the Buffalo-Red River Watershed District (BRRWD) in partnership with landowners, federal, state, and local agencies, will put much of the rerouted channel back restoring up to 4.6 miles of the South Branch with up to 100 acres of associated riparian habitat corridor. Additional restorations of straightened stream and river channels along the South Branch and Whisky Creek will be completed as funding permits.","The construction of several legal ditch systems and other channel straightening efforts eliminated hundreds of acres of quality of stream habitat within the BRRWD. In some cases, the channelization simply straightened the stream channel and in others the constructed ditch diverted water away from the natural stream. Straightened channels create homogenous habitats, they no longer have the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by fish at various stages in their life cycle. The straightened reaches also tend to lose access to their floodplains which increases erosion in the channel and causes downstream flooding. In addition, aggradation of the downstream channel due to increased sediment loading reduces habitat quality and makes flooding worse. Over the last several years, the BRRWD, with input and in partnership with landowners, federal, state, and local agencies, designed comprehensive subwatershed restoration plans and intends to implement these plans over the next several years. A component of these plans includes the restoration of numerous reaches of straightened and abandoned creek and river channels throughout the Watershed District. Prioritization of projects is largely based on ecological benefits, being shovel-ready and having landowner and other stakeholder support. In the first phase of this multi-phase project, the BRRWD plans to restore up to 4.6 miles of perennial stream with up to 100 plus acres of associated riparian corridor habitat along the South Branch of the Buffalo River. The project will divert water from Wilkin County Ditch No. 44 (formerly called Judicial Ditch 3) back into the abandoned South Branch channel. The South Branch will be restored using natural channel design principles. The river restoration has been designed with direct input from the MN DNR Stream Habitat Program as well as the MN Board of Water & Soil Resources (BWSR). A sinuous riffle-pool natural channel design is proposed to recreate the aquatic habitat diversity that was lost in the straightened ditch. The naturally stable restored channel will not only recreate lost habitat, but will reduce the current erosion that is overloading downstream reaches of the South Branch. This project is being completed in conjunction with a Reinvest in Minnesota project being implemented by the MN BWSR. As part of their comprehensive subwatershed planning process, the District has completed planning and design on three additional stream reaches which are included as part of this application package. These include the restoration of Whisky Creek, its tributary, and the South Branch of the Buffalo River and their associated riparian corridors. Additional stream restoration enhancement along the South Branch of the Buffalo River and Whisky Creek will be completed as funding permits when and if additional sources of match funding become available. Combined, these comprehensive projects have the potential to restore and enhance more than 38 miles of natural prairie stream.

",,150000,,,,,,"Rice Soil and Water Conservation District","Local/Regional Government","The Cannon River Watershed is a diverse watershed from the standpoint of topography, land use, and land cover, but a central issue of concern is increased sedimentation and turbidity within the river. One of the best ways to keep sediment from entering the Cannon River is to install vegetative buffers on the smaller tributaries in the upper reaches of the watershed. This project is important as it aims to help identify strategic locations where buffers are needed and to assist landowners to install buffers that will directly help reduce sedimentation within the watershed. Doing so will help the watershed work towards its goal of lessening the turbidity impairment for the Cannon River. The Cannon River Watershed Partnership (CRWP) began a project a few years ago to map the land use in riparian areas for a few of the counties of the watershed. This data is important for Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) within the watershed in order to target the most effective places in the landscape for buffers and other conservation practices. One objective of this project is to complete the mapping project for Waseca and Le Sueur Counties, which will result in the majority of the watersheds riparian areas being mapped. This project will also provide incentives to landowners in Rice, Goodhue, Waseca, and Le Sueur Counties to install buffers and to sign up for conservation programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to provide long term protection and buffers of streams within the watershed. Currently, more than 100 acres of new buffers are already enrolled to be installed because of this project. The Rice SWCD is the lead for this project, in collaboration with its neighboring SWCD partners and the CRWP.

Protection of this large complex will provide opportunities for public hunting, fishing and wildlife conservation.The Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex Phase II effort will address the following problems: degradation and loss of quality and diversity of habitat in the prairie section of the State; degradation of water quality in the Cannon River Watershed; and lack of available public lands for hunting and angling opportunities, especially within an hour’s drive for over half of the state’s population.Located just south of the Twin Cities metro in an area that has seen development pressure due to the close proximity of the Twin Cities, I-35 and the Upper Cannon Lakes, much of this part of the state has already suffered fragmentation and habitat loss. Historically inhabited by Big Woods, the landscape is now dominated by agricultural fields and, to a lesser extent, development. Agricultural practices and shoreline development are also the major contributors to the impaired status of stretches of the Cannon River and its associated lakes and streams.This conservation effort is part of a multi-year effort that includes acquisition, protection, and restoration of core parcels of land that will contribute to a large complex of restored prairies, grasslands, wetlands, lakeshore, and river shoreline. The complex is encircled by the Upper Cannon River, starting at its headwaters at Shields Lake where it flows west, then as it flows south and east through the towns of Waterville and Morristown, and then as it heads northeast before reaching the city of Faribault.The initial acquisitions are prioritized toward existing large wetland/upland complexes, rare communities (Big Woods forest, tamarack swamp), shallow lakes, river shoreline, and lands adjacent to existing protected areas. Landowner willingness to sell and the threat of development are also taken into consideration. Restoration work will be focused on the degraded portions of the lands acquired (approximately 175 acres) and will include restoration of agricultural fields near wetlands, lakes, rivers and existing protected areas to native habitat.Protection and restoration of these significant parcels will provide critical habitat for game species, including migratory waterfowl (mallards, canvasback, wood ducks, hooded mergansers, pintails, lesser scaup), upland birds (dove, turkey, pheasant, and woodcock) white tail deer, and fish (northern pike, black crappies, bluegills, bullheads and walleye). Protection will also provide access for a diversity of recreational experiences including duck, pheasant, turkey and deer hunting as well as river, stream, and lake fishing. Non-game wildlife, including Species in Greatest Conservation Need, likely to benefit from this protection and restoration work includes Bald Eagle, Bell’s Vireo, Cerulean Warbler, Loggerhead Shrike, Sandhill Crane, Red-headed Woodpecker, Greater Yellowlegs, Buff-breasted Sandpiper, Short-billed Dowitcher, Blanding’s Turtle, Mudpuppies, and the Giant Floater, a species of freshwater mussel.Protecting and restoring vegetative cover within basins and the riparian areas of the lakes, rivers, and streams in this focus area will also help protect water quality by reducing surface water runoff and by providing ecological services such as infiltration through natural buffers to our waterways. All wildlife—and humans—will benefit from improved water quality.The DNR’s Southern Region Conservation Focus Area assessment tool ranked the Cannon River area as having the highest level of inter-divisional conservation priority when examined at the landscape level (score= 6).Work will be completed in phases depending on funding availability. Properties targeted for acquisition and restoration as part of this Phase II request to LSOHC (FY13) include the following:Tamaracque WMA (addition)- tract 28 (Rice County)These 200 acres of rolling terrain with grasslands, forest, and wetlands riparian to the Cannon River are located within a 1000-acre complex of MCBS-identified habitat with high biodiversity significance. Rare communities include Big Woods, some of the southern- most occurrence of Tamarack Swamp in the state, and mixed emergent marsh & prairie. The diversity of marshes and lowland brush is important for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species. The mix of wetland and upland habitats provide nesting areas for waterfowl. Restoration would include minimal tree and shrub plantings to provide nesting cover and minimal wetland restoration. This property also provides easy road access for excellent hunting and wildlife viewing opportunities.Lake WMA (new)- tracts 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (Rice County) These 260 acres of rolling croplands, grasslands, forest, and wetlands include lands riparian to the shallow Caron Lake and an unditched tributary, Devil’s Creek, which is very rare in this area of the state. Due to limited funding, protection will be targeted toward a portion of this property. The property is adjacent to the Caron Lake Aquatic Management Area and contains approximately half mile of frontage on Caron Lake. The area is within a complex of shallow lakes that drain into the Cannon River. Protecting shoreline vegetation on Caron Lake is important for spawning and nursery habitat for northern pike and other native fishes; protecting natural buffers/water quality is critical for walleye downstream in Cedar Lake. This area is known to host both divers and puddle ducks during the fall migration. This is a great production area for turkey, deer, and other forest species, and extensive hunting opportunities would be available with direct and easy access provided by this acquisition. These tracts provide the opportunity to restore some farmed land in this sensitive water quality area to wetlands, grasslands, and either Oak Savannah or Big Woods habitat. Restoration will provide substantial payback for waterfowl and other marsh denizens given the complex of habitats within a biologically meaningful proximity.The Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex effort is supported by the Cannon River Watershed Partnership, the Tri-Lake Sports Club, the Dark House Anglers Southern Chapter, Minnesota Deer Hunters Association South Central Prairieland Bucks Chapter (Le Sueur, Rice, Waseca, and Steele Counties), Waterville Sportsman’s Club, Montgomery Sportsmen’s Club, Minnesota Waterfowl Association Scott- LeSueur Chapter, the Izaak Walton League Owatonna Chapter, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Groups listed have already or will be providing a letter of support.PlanningAcquisition of high quality habitat and restoration of degraded habitat within the Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex furthers the goals and strategies of numerous resource management plans including:Minnesota Statewide Conservation and Preservation Plan (MSCPP)L-SOHC Prairie Section VisionCannon River Watershed Partnership (CRWP) Strategic Plan 2009-2012Minnesota Forest Resources Council (MFRC) and Minnesota Forest Resources Partnership’s (MFRP) Recommended 25-year LSOHC Forest Priorities Vision: Prairie SectionMN DNR Long Range Duck Recovery PlanMN DNR Long Range Plan for the Ring-Necked PheasantRice County Water Resource Management PlanLe Sueur County Local Water Management Plan 2006-2015DNR’s AMA and WMA Acquisition PlansThe MSCPP states “habitat issues are arguably the most important issues facing the conservation and preservation of natural resources throughout Minnesota” (p 31). The Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex project addresses multiple habitat issues by furthering the listed Habitat Recommendations. The project will “restore ecoregion-appropriate, landscape-scale complexes of habitat centered on concentrations of existing remnant habitats with a broader goal of developing/maintaining conservation corridors between existing and restored habitats” (p 66). It will “ critical shorelands of streams and lakes”, by focusing on “shoreline buffers…[which] protect water quality by trapping, filtering and impeding runoff laden with nutrients, sediments and other pollutants” (p 67). The project will also “improve connectivity and access to outdoor recreation” (p 74), by protecting “contiguous land areas suitable for: natural resource–based outdoor recreation; shorelands; threatened habitat areas with opportunities to improve connectivity of underserved areas; and rapidly growing areas or areas where land use changes may limit future outdoor recreation opportunities” (p 76). The project also addresses the habitat recommendation to “restore land, wetlands and wetland-associated watersheds” which is “especially imperative in the prairie and prairie-forest transition zones of the state” (p 80).The Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex project fits nearly all of the Priority Actions listed in the L-SOHC Prairie Section Vision. The project will “protect, enhance, or restore existing wetland/upland complexes, or convert agricultural lands to new wetland/upland habitat complexes” and “protect, enhance and restore remnant native prairie, Big Woods forests and oak savannah”. By protecting and restoring lands containing large habitat complexes and those adjacent to and near existing AMA’s, WMA’s, and WPA’s, the project will convert agricultural land to wetland/upland to protect, enhance, or restore existing habitat complexes, and restore or enhance habitat on public lands, while providing fantastic opportunities for public recreation proximate to the Twin Cities urban area and outstate MN. Protecting and restoring the wetlands, uplands and riparian areas especially located around Caron Lake meet the priority actions to “protect, restore and enhance shallow lakes” and “protect, enhance and restore migratory habitat for waterfowl and related species, so as to increase migratory and breeding success”.The CRWP Strategic Plan lists their mission and the vision for the Cannon River Headwaters. This project furthers their vision of a “healthy watershed with clean water that is fishable, swimmable, and drinkable” and contributes to their mission of “protecting and improving the water quality and natural systems of the Cannon River watershed” (p 2).The Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex project furthers the vision and goals of the MFRC and MFRP’s Recommendations for the Prairie Section of the state: the area of Rice and Le Sueur County included in this effort is specifically shown in their recommendation as a “Forest and Wildlife Habitat Priority Area” (Big Woods).The MN DNR Long Range Duck Recovery Plan states “Minnesota has lost more than 90% of its prairie wetlands” (p 8). The project employs the primary breeding strategy of the plan: “to [restore and protect] two million additional acres (30% wetland, 70% grassland) of habitat in wetland/grassland habitat complexes,” especially in seasonal basins and including shallow lakes (p 3). The Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex project also furthers the recreation strategy by “improving the quantity and quality of duck hunting and viewing opportunities” (p 5).The Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex effort helps accomplish MN DNR’s Long Range Plan for the Ring-Necked Pheasant by restoring grassland habitat as well as protecting shrub-scrub wetlands and other dense woody habitat in close proximity: “Because most pheasants move <2 miles between summer and winter range, both reproductive habitat and at least 1 winter area must be available within a 9-square mile landscape to sustain a population over the long term” (p 6).The project also meets the following overall water resource management goals from the Rice County Water Resource Management Plan: “Protect, preserve, and manage natural surface and groundwater storage systems”, “prevent erosion of soil into surface water systems”, and “protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat and water recreational facilities” (iii). The plan also lists wetlands as one of the County’s priority issues. The Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex project meets the management goal to “restore pre-settlement wetlands that provide valuable fish and wildlife habitat, that act as recharge areas for groundwater to filter pollutants” (p vi)The LeSueur County Local Water Management Plan lists their priority concerns and goals to address the concerns. The Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex project will create: “protected, restored and improved surface water quality in lakes, rivers and streams” and “minimized impacts from runoff of development areas and agricultural land that alter surface water hydrology” by addressing Objective 7: “Increase the number of wetland restoration acreage in the county” (p 3).Lastly, the effort helps fulfill the strategies of the DNR’s AMA and WMA acquisition plans: “[lake and warm water stream and river acquisitions] should be concentrated in the north central lakes and transition area between the prairie/grassland and forested portions of the state where development and land use pressures, habitat fragmentation, and increased demand for water-based outdoor recreation will continue to expand” (the Cannon River Headwaters Habitat Complex is located in the latter for purposes of AMA; p 20). The effort follows guidance in the WMA plan that “emphasis should be placed on habitat in larger complexes of grassland/wetland…including core wintering areas for resident wildlife species, and needed nesting habitat” (p 11).All parcels have been scored through DNR Division of Wildlife’s scientific SWAAT WMA scoring tool and have been ranked as priority acquisitions with a score of 12 or above. Additionally, the DNR’s Southern Region Conservation Focus Area assessment tool ranked the Cannon River area as having the highest level of inter-divisional conservation priority when examined at the landscape level (score= 6).",2012-07-01,2016-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Robert,McGillivray,"The Trust for Public Land","2610 University Ave West, Suite 300","St. Paul",MN,55114,"(651) 999-5307",rjm@tpl.org,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,Rice,"Prairie Region",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/cannon-river-headwaters-habitat-complex-phase-2,,,,

Historically inhabited by Big Woods, the landscape is now dominated by agricultural fields and, to a lesser extent, development. Agricultural practices and shoreline development are also the major contributors to the impaired status of stretches of the Cannon River and its associated lakes and streams.This conservation effort is part of a multi-year effort that includes acquisition, protection, and restoration of core parcels of land that will contribute to a large complex of restored prairies, grasslands, wetlands, lakeshore, and river shoreline.These acquisitions are prioritized toward existing large wetland/upland complexes, rare communities (Big Woods forest, tamarack swamp), shallow lakes, river shoreline, and lands adjacent to existing protected areas. Landowner willingness to sell and the threat of development are also taken into consideration. Restoration work will be focused on the degraded portions of the lands acquired (approximately 50 acres) and will include restoration of agricultural fields near wetlands, lakes, rivers and existing protected areas to native habitat.Protection and restoration of these significant parcels will provide critical habitat for game species, including migratory waterfowl (mallards, canvasback, wood ducks, hooded mergansers, pintails, and lesser scaup), upland birds (dove, turkey, pheasant, and woodcock), white tail deer, and fish (northern pike, black crappies, bluegills, bullheads and walleye). Protection will also provide access for a diversity of recreational experiences including duck, pheasant, turkey and deer hunting as well as river, stream, and lake fishing. Non-game wildlife, including species in Greatest Conservation Need, likely to benefit from this protection and restoration work includes Bald Eagle, Bell’s Vireo, Cerulean Warbler, Loggerhead Shrike, Sandhill Crane, Red-headed Woodpecker, Greater Yellowlegs, Buff-breasted Sandpiper, Short billed Dowitcher, Blanding’s Turtle, Mudpuppies, and the Giant Floater, a species of freshwater mussel. Protecting and restoring vegetative cover within basins and the riparian areas of the lakes, rivers and streams in this focus area will also help protect water quality by reducing surface water runoff and by providing ecological services such as infiltration through natural buffers to our waterways. All wildlife-and humans –will benefit from improved water quality.The DNR’s Southern Region Conservation Focus Area assessment tool ranked the Cannon River area as having the highest level of inter-divisional conservation priority when examined at the landscape level.Work will be completed in phases depending on funding availability and landowner willingness to sell. Properties targeted for acquisition and restoration as part of this Phase IV request to LSOHC (FY15) include the following:Dora Lake WMA tracts 2 & 5 (Le Sueur County)These lands build on the new 510-acre Dora Lake WMA property that was created with FY 12 Outdoor Heritage Funds. This large upland-wetland complex contains Minnesota County Biological Survey (MCBS)-identifed native habitat including a portion of remnant Big Woods, some southern-most occurrence of tamarack swamp in the state, and over 2 miles of naturally flowing Cannon River, directly upstream from a concentration of rare freshwater mussels. These new tracts would add another ¼ mile of Cannon River and an island of tamaracks to the WMA. Boyd Sartell WMA – tracts 3 & 5 (Rice County)These two tracts contain diverse marsh habitats and about 100 acres of uplands consisting of oak islands and grassy knolls, Big Woods and tamarack forests, and over ¼ mile of the headwaters of the Cannon River. The acquisition will protect seasonally flooded wetlands and other key habitats for waterfowl and wetland wildlife ranging from sedge wrens and ring-necked ducks to sandhill cranes and trumpeter swans. The area also provides habitat for species of conservation need, including colonial waterbirds and Blanding’s turtles. Koester Prairie WMA – tract 1 (Rice County)This parcel contains approximately 200 acres of rolling grassland, prairie and oak savanna that are associated with Prairie Creek and its tributaries and that directly buffer approximately 130 acres of rare and highly significant native prairie that is currently protected with a native prairie bank easement. Forty-one native upland prairie species have been documented here as well as a number of sedge meadow and wet prairie species. Bird species in Greatest Conservation Need utilizing this site include: Swanson’s Hawk, Upland Sandpiper, Red-headed Woodpecker, Grasshopper Sparrow and Bobolink. The US Fish and Wildlife Service is providing $10 K matching funds for restoration of this property through their Partners in Fish and Wildlife Program.Le Tamaracque WMA (addition)- tract 28 (Rice County)These 200 acres of rolling terrain with grasslands, forest, and wetlands riparian to the Cannon River are located within a 1000-acre complex of MCBS-identified habitat with high biodiversity significance. Rare communities include Big Woods, some of the southern- most occurrence of Tamarack Swamp in the state, and mixed emergent marsh & prairie.  The diversity of marshes and lowland brush is important for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent species. The mix of wetland and upland habitats provide nesting areas for waterfowl. Caron Lake WMA (new) - tracts 4,5,6,7 and 8 (Rice County)These 260 acres of rolling croplands, grasslands, forest and wetlands include lands riparian to the shallow Caron Lake and an unditched tributary, Devil's Creek, which is very rare in this area of the state. The property is adjacent to the Caron Lake AMA, and within a complex of shallow lakes that drain into the Cannon River.

Rather than delay the expenditure of OHF funds on the ground, remaining funds budgeted for construction were used to enhance another reach of Pine Creek.  This 1,800 foot long reach of enhanced habitat on Pine Creek will support greater numbers of adult trout and likely receive far heavier use than Whitewater River reach would have.These projects employed the same successful strategy used in the projects done by MNTU chapters and the MNDNR in the past decade.  Each project involved the installation of in-stream fish habitat structures, in addition to measures which have reduced stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation, and reconnected streams to their flood plains to reduce negative impacts from severe flooding.  The specific fish habitat restoration or enhancement methods used on each stream varied slightly depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each ecological region, as well as variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed.  Each project was tailored to the site after close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota DNR.  The projects were designed and implemented to accomplish a number of these purposes:  a) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation, b) reconnect streams to their flood plains to reduce negative impacts from severe flooding, c) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms, d) maintain or increase adult trout abundance, e) increase biodiversity for both in-stream and non-game species, f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required, and g) improve angler access.  Project partners included the MNDNR, Pheasants Forever, and Minnesota citizens.  The MNDNR was a key partner on every project, helping to identifying priority project sites, offering professional input on designs, providing permitting review, and other support.  Dedicated members of Pheasants Forever accomplished an excellent prairie restoration on the upland areas of the Vermilion River site.  We encountered strong support from local communities, local businesses, community clubs, sporting groups, anglers, the MNDNR and the general public.  ",2010-07-01,2015-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,"Minnesota Council of Trout Unlimited","PO Box 845",Chanhassen,MN,55317,"(612) 670-1629",jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Dakota, Fillmore, Goodhue, Wabasha, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/cold-water-river-and-stream-restoration-protection-and-enhancement-0,,,,

The specific fish habitat enhancement methods used on each stream varied depending upon the distinct natural resource characteristics of each watershed and ecological region, the limiting factors identified for each stream, and the variations in the type and magnitude of poor land uses practices within each watershed. MNTU tailored each project accordingly, using the best available science, in close consultation with resource professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (“MNDNR”). Purposes: Each project was designed and completed using techniques selected to accomplish one or more of the following purposes: (a) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream; (b) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative resource impacts from severe flooding; (c) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms; (d) maintain or increase adult trout abundance; (e) increase habitat and biodiversity for both invertebrates and other non-game species; (f) be long lasting with minimal maintenance required; (g) improve angler access and participation; (h) improve lake productivity for trout species; and (i) protect productive trout waters from undesirable invasive species. Habitat enhancement methods: Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel and help cool the water. Agricultural area example: Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices. The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive streamside sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas. In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem. To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps. First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas. Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain. Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock. In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used. After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created. Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone. Two methods are used to remedy this situation: increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks. Wooden structures are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them. Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality. Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native prairie grasses may be planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year. Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction. In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.

Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive streamside sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them. Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native prairie grasses may be planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations. The following projects, totaling more than 7.5 miles of stream and 91 acres, were completed with FY2012 funds: 1. Garvin Brook (Winona); 2. Hay Creek (Goodhue); 3. Seven Mile Creek (Nicollet); 4.

CPL Program Staff develop a Request for Proposal/Program Manual incorporating LSOHC  priorities, solicit applications, work with applicants to submit scorable applications, oversee grant selection, prepare/execute grant documents, review expenditure documentation, ensure financial integrity, make payments, monitor grant work, assist recipients with closing out agreements, and prepare required reports.   Applicants describe: location of work, activity type and habitat; benefit to habitat, fish, game and wildlife; and duration of benefits.  Acquisition projects: applicants describe parcel selection process.   CPL staff complies with the Department of Administration-Office of Grants Management policies.  Stakeholders involved in this program are applicants, reviewers, land managers.  No opposition is known.  Application Process A Request for Proposal/Program Manual was posted on the CPL website in August, 2013.  Document contains all grant program information. Applications are submitted using CPL’s Online Grant Application System (OLGA).  Applicants use OLGA’s mapping tool to map project sites.  Applications accepted beginning in August, 2013, until round one deadline in mid-September, 2013.  Applications requesting grants up to $25,000 or Preapproved Project Grants have a shorter application form. The application system will accept Preapproved Project Grant applications year-round.  Examples of Preapproved Projects and criteria for each will be on the website. Grants over or under $25,000 were selected for funding once.  Preapproved (ECP) Project Grants were awarded 4 times during the year. DNR were able to make additional awards under this announcement, consistent with DNR and OHF policy and guidance, if additional funding became available or if a grantee could not complete a project as planned.  Grant Selection Process CPL Grant Program Staff review applications for completeness.  Technical Review Committee(s), selected by the Commissioner of Natural Resources, evaluate applications based on criteria listed below.  A final score is given to all applications. Committee(s) include representatives from DNR, BWSR, the University of MN, state universities or private colleges, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, or other appropriate members from government, non-profit and business organizations.  A final ranking committee of Directors of the DNR Divisions of Fish and Wildlife, Ecological Resources/Waters, and Forestry consider TRC, Division and Regional DNR comments, and recommend projects/funding levels to the Commissioner.  Preapproved Project Grants are reviewed by CPL staff, using criteria established for each type of project, and make recommendations. The Commissioner makes final decisions.  CPL Grant Program staff work with grantees to complete financial reviews, grant agreements, and other paperwork.  Work may not begin until grant is executed. Application Criteria Applications is evaluated on these criteria:         Amount of habitat restored, enhanced, or protected Local support        Degree of collaboration        Urgency        Multiple benefits        Habitat benefits        Consistency with current conservation science        Adjacent to protected lands        Full funding of project       Budget/ cost effectiveness       Public access for hunting/fishing       Use of native plant materials       Applicants’ capacity to successfully complete, sustain work Project Reviews and Reporting Grantees submit annual accomplishment reports on forms provided by CPL staff, based on L-SOHC report forms.  Reports account for the use of grant/match funds, and outcomes in measures of wetlands, prairies, forests, and fish, game, and wildlife habitat restored, enhanced, and protected.  The report must include an evaluation of these results.  A final report is required by all grantees 30 days after project completion.  CPL Grant staff submits accomplishment reports to L-SOHC as required.   CPL Administration Budget Grant administration costs total $366,000, include salary/fringe for grants staff, direct and necessary costs, travel, supplies, and expense.  An internal Service Level Agreement (SLA) is developed with DNR’s Management Information Systems to update/manage the online grant application system.  DNR Land Acquisition Costs Applicants are required to budget for DNR Land Acquisition costs that are necessary to support the land acquisition process for parcels to be conveyed to the DNR.  These costs are billed to awarded grants on a professional services basis. DNR Technical Support The Division of Fish and Wildlife provides ongoing technical guidance, helping applicants prepare grant proposals and meet requirements for working on state lands.  Project development and oversight is provided by area managers and additional guidance is provided for land acquisitions.   Grantee Payment Grantees are paid on reimbursement or “for services rendered” basis, meaning payment is made to the grantee after work has been performed or materials purchased, but before the vendor is paid by the grantee.  Grantees provide proof that work is completed or a purchase made to receive payment.  Proof that the vendor was paid must be submitted to CPL staff before additional grant payments are made.  Reasonable amounts may be advanced to projects to accommodate cash flow needs, match federal share, or for acquisitions.  Advances must be specified in final grant agreement.  Partial payments are allowed.  Funds are built into grants for required Legacy logo signage and forms of acknowledgement/notification including, but not limited to, local news advertisements announcing completion of grantees' projects. Since the creation of the CPL program, grantees have restored, protected or enhanced nearly 9982 acres of habitat in Minnesota.

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Streams in Minnesota support a wealth of biodiversity, including 162 fish species and 48 mussel species of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers pursue.Streams can be degraded by habitat alterations such as dams, channelization (straightening), and streambank erosion. Barriers such as dams block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas, and can lead to reduced abundance or even the loss of fish and mussel species. Past fish passage projects have returned up to 10 species, including walleye, sauger, and channel catfish, to miles of river where they had disappeared. All proposed fish passage projects have no known potential to enable access by invasive species.Past channelization of streams simplified habitat and eliminated the shallow riffles and deeper pools required by different life stages of fish. Streambank erosion results in a loss of important undercut bank and overhanging vegetation, and contributes excess sediment that degrades habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our original proposal included 12 projects in four LSOHC planning regions (refer to Figure 1). Although the footprint of projects is 54 acres which includes 2.6 miles of stream, the projects would benefit over 10,900 acres of lakes and streams through restoration or enhancement of fish passage (refer to Table 1). Projects were selected from a prioritized list using criteria such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support.

DNR proposes to restore or enhance aquatic habitat under two programs: stream restoration, and Aquatic Management Area (AMA) enhancement. Stream restoration includes major channel restorations and fish passage projects such as dam removals intended to improve or provide access to critical aquatic habitats. AMA enhancement will improve habitat on shorelines and their associated uplands, providing critical spawning habitat for fish, and riparian habitat critical for many species of amphibians, turtles, and birds.","Projects planned through this appropriation fall into two categories: stream restoration, and Aquatic Management Area enhancement. Through these programs, DNR will complete habitat projects on both lakes and rivers for the benefit of fish and other aquatic species.MN DNR is a national leader in stream restoration, having innovated and refined restoration techniques of the past 30+ years. An example is the removal or modification of dams on the Red River to allow fish passage, which has resulted in native fish (e.g., channel catfish and walleye) returning or increasing in reaches upstream of former barriers. Projects in our plan are prioritized based on factors such as the scale of benefiting waters, local support, rare species, and project urgency. Quite often dam removal/modification projects are done on old dams in need of repair. If removal/modification funds are not available, it is possible that partners may seek funds elsewhere to repair or replace the dam, which represents a potential missed opportunity to address fish passage. Our prioritized list includes submissions from several partners including watershed districts, local governments, and Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs). Partners are often able to handle local logistics and provide some in-kind or financial match. In this accomplishment plan we have included 12 stream restoration projects, which includes 5 channel restorations and 7 fish passage projects. This plan also continues support of a position previously funded LSOHF that coordinates stream restoration projects, providing surveying, design, permitting, and contracting support to enable DNR to complete these additional projects. The amount of funding recommended by the Lessard Council is not sufficient to complete all of the projects on our parcel table. We will select projects based on our prioritized list (included in attachments), completing our top projects as funding allows. We currently expect to complete the North Fork Zumbro River and Miller Creek channel restorations, and the Shell River fish passage project. If we are successful in securing additional funds from other grants, we may be able to complete additional projects. All stream projects will utilize Natural Channel Design methods in order to create long-lasting projects with appropriate habitat.DNR owns almost 1,400 AMA parcels totaling over 34,000 acres of lake and river shoreline and associated uplands. These parcels encompass critical habitat for fish, turtles, frogs, and birds that depend on shoreline habitat. Quality habitat often requires ongoing maintenance such as invasive plant removal, prescribed burns, and planting of native species. The DNR's Section of Fisheries manages AMAs but has limited capacity and expertise to manage these lands.

","Almost by definition, the prairie is a disturbance-dependent habitat or ecosystem. The diversity and productivity of grasslands is structured by three factors; fire, periodic grazing, and weather extremes especially periodic droughts. While we have no direct control over short-term weather patterns, one of the primary goals of enhancement / management work is replicating the historic fire and grazing patterns that maintained the diversity and productivity of the prairies. In recent years, Minnesota has lost large amounts of grasslands. CRP acres are down 770,000 acres since their peak in 2007. We continue to lose native prairie to the plow, housing development, and gravel quarry. Because of these losses of grassland and wetland habitat across western Minnesota, it is that much more important that the public grasslands in this region are as productive as possible for wildlife and pollinators. This programmatic request seeks funding to enhance grassland habitat on permanently protected grasslands and prairies, most of which are open to public hunting. Without periodic management to simulate historical disturbance patterns, grassland become less diverse and less productive. Invasive species may increase and woody vegetation will encroach into the grasslands, changing their very character and the species that inhabit the area.

Projects will benefit fish such as walleye, smallmouth bass, and northern pike present in these rivers, as well as five mussel species classified as threatened or special concern. If cost savings or other circumstances allow, we will use available funds for our next highest achievable project on the priority list.The modification of the Phelps Mill Dam was previously funded by the Outdoor Heritage in the ML2016 appropriation. However, the dam owner (Otter Tail County) is now willing to adopt our preferred option of a full modification of the dam rather than the previous option of a partial fishway. The bigger project will make for better fish passage, and will create additional spawning habitat within the created rapids. However, the cost of such a project is higher. An additional $800,000 from this appropriation will be used to complete the project, allowing us to take full advantage of a $300,000 US Fish and Wildlife Service grant.

The prescribed burn on Benderberg WMA triggered an excellent response in the native wet prairie remnant.  It was largely an after-thought at this was former pasture, but the presence of fire really benefitted the native plant community.  There was even some hand- harvest opportunity for species like wood lily.  Without the roving crew and the MarshTracker, an Rx burn on this site would not have been possible.  This was the first time much of this ground had seen a fire in over 4 decades.  The plan is to periodically maintain this WMA with fire going forward and to maintain/enhance the wet prairie community that so wonderfully responded to it the first time around. These funds were used to complete more than 50 acres of woody control projects on the Lake Bronson and Two Rivers Aspen Parkland Scientific and Natural Areas.  These projects were part of an ongoing multi-year strategy to combat the encroachment of woody vegetation into high quality native prairies.  In addition to setting back encroaching willows and aspen, the Lake Bronson SNA project appeared to have positive impacts on the sites population of western prairie fringed orchids (a Federally threatened species) as the second highest number of orchids ever recorded on the site were counted the spring following the project.   One untold stories is the cooperation between conservation agencies and NGOs in Minnesota.  In some states, feds don’t like the state, and the NGOs fight among themselves.  In Minnesota, we all get along really well.  This is evidenced in partnership efforts that developed the Prairie Plan and Pheasant Plan.  One early fear with OHF is that this would cause these groups to start bickering over the resource.  In fact, the exact opposite has happened.  It has pulled us together and increased cooperation.  One example of that is our collective seed harvest and grassland restoration efforts.  In at least two areas, most notably Detroit Lakes and the Glacial Lakes area, multiple agencies/NGOs are coordinating their seed harvest and restoration efforts.    Partners are looking 1 to 3 years ahead on restoration efforts.  Seed production is best on burned sites.  Partners are determining what units and what soil types they want to restore each year.  Then they find native tracts or high diversity restorations with similar soil types.  These sites are prioritized for burning in the spring.   Once the site is burned, partners again work together to harvest and store the seed in the fall.  The seed is then distributed to the DNR, USFWS, TNC or other partners.  The seed is spread on the sites in the late winter or early spring.  In some cases, agency/NGO staff are harvesting the seed.  In other cases, they work with local contractors to harvest the seed.   Harvesting local seed is both cost-effective and when harvesting native tracts ensures we, collectively, are using a diverse mix of local ecotype seed.   Again, the OHF has helped developed new partnerships and projects that would not have happened or that would have happened at a much smaller scale with these critical funds.   Because this is a programmatic appropriation, it’s difficult to assign a dollar amount to a specific project.  Because of this and the large number of projects, we simply assigned dollars to projects proportional to acres completed in that project.  In the same way, we proportionally assigned dollars to personnel based on FTEs.     ",2013-07-01,2018-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Greg,Hoch,"MN DNR","500 Lafayette Road ","St Paul",MN,55155,651-259-5230,greg.hoch@state.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Becker, Beltrami, Big Stone, Blue Earth, Brown, Clay, Cottonwood, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Goodhue, Grant, Houston, Jackson, Kandiyohi, Kittson, Lac qui Parle, Lyon, Marshall, Martin, Nobles, Norman, Otter Tail, Polk, Pope, Redwood, Renville, Rice, Roseau, Sibley, Stevens, Swift, Traverse, Wabasha, Winona, Yellow Medicine","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/dnr-grassland-phase-5,,,,

Minnesota's Scientific and Natural Area program currently administers over 220 natural areas totaling 215,600 acres and 100 Native Prairie Bank easements.Enhancing existing acres and restoring new acres in the WMA system are core management principles of the DNR. These WMAs provide diverse food and cover for local and migratory wildlife, as well as pollinators. Restoration and enhancement practices being used with this proposal have been proven to provide desired outcomes on existing state-managed lands and reflect the most current science in the areas of habitat management and restoration ecology. Through this funding, the state will accelerate restoration and enhancement habitat improvements on state land and lands protected by permanent easement. This will provide improved critical wildlife habitat and a more functional prairie landscape. Habitat improvement actions enhance existing degraded habitat to directly increase the productivity of nesting habitat for pheasants, waterfowl and a variety of non-game grassland species such as meadowlarks, longspurs, Species of Greatest Conservation Need and a suite of critical pollinator species. In recent years almost every species of wildlife dependent on grasslands and prairies has declined. Since 2007, Minnesota has lost 530,000 acres of CRP. Uncounted acres of native prairie have also been lost. The following are taken from the DNR’s 2014 Status of Wildlife Populations Report. Waterfowl: “The estimate of total duck abundance…was 31% lower than last year’s estimate…and was 25% below the 10-year average and 24% below the long-term average.” Pheasants: “The 2014 range-wide pheasant index (28.7 birds/100 mi) increased 6% from 2013 but was 58% below the 10-year average and 71% below the long-term average.” From the 2014 State of the Birds Report: “Eastern grassland birds (such as Eastern Meadowlark and Bobolink) have continued a steady and precipitous decline.” The Dakota Skippers and Poweshiek skipperlings are now federally listed, the decline in honeybees monarch butterflies have generated national media attention. Aquatic habitats in western Minnesota are also declining. Studies by the University of Minnesota and the MPCA have shown links to water quality and grassland habitat. Restoration of new grasslands and enhancement of existing grasslands is crucial to changing these declines in wildlife populations and water quality. Although Minnesota DNR has the training and knowledge to restore high quality prairie vegetation current funding has been insufficient to meet all needs. Many sites on state lands are currently not being actively managed to full potential. Furthermore exotic and/or invasive plants are encroaching into them. Tree encroachment is an especially troublesome problem. Enhancement and restoration of prairie requires periodic disturbance such as prescribed burning, conservation grazing, and haying. Harvesting and using high quality seed from established prairie sites to plant at nearby locations has proven to be highly cost-effective and ensures the use of local ecotype seed. WMA Habitat Work (approximately 37,000 acres over 5 years) – Total $1,105,400 + 289,000 for Direct and Necessary for WMA Habitat Work and Roving CrewsGrassland enhancement work will be through techniques such as brush and tree removal, grassland conversion, chemical treatment, mowing, and prescribed fire. Seed will be obtained via harvesting of local native or restored prairie when possible and purchase of seed from vendors when necessary (following Operational Order 124). DNR will contract much of this work. Seed mixes used for prairie restoration and enhancement will be adequately diverse to provide pollinator habitat throughout the growing season. All other work will be done using Best Management Practices to ensure pollinator habitat consistent with MN Statute 84.973. Ecological and Water Resources Habitat Work (approximately 2360 acres over 5 years) – Total $1,007,400 Restoration of prairie will occur on 387 acres of severely altered lands by reconstructing native plant communities suitable to that location and soil type. These restorations are either in-holdings within a native prairie, or lands adjacent to a native prairie. Seed will be collected from native prairies adjacent to the restorations or purchased from vendors with local seed sources. Seed mixes will be adequately diverse to provide pollinator habitat throughout the growing season. These restorations will expand existing prairie habitat and buffer native prairies from the impacts of adjacent land uses. Funding requested for restoration projects will cover all costs and activities associated with reconstructing a prairie including project design, seedbed preparation, seed harvest, seed installation, and first year weed control. Prairie enhancement activities will be implemented on 6510 acres of existing SNA's, State Forest Land and Prairie Bank Easement sites. Funding requested for enhancement projects will cover all project costs and activities including project design, contract administration, staff time, equipment and supplies. These enhancement activities will focus on native prairies, but may include some restored prairies within the project sites. Many of these native prairie sites harbor rare and unique features, or are located on steep terrain, which require low impact management techniques (e.g. hand cutting of woody encroachment). These specialized prairie management techniques, and the skilled crews that implement them, can incur higher costs than similar lower diversity grassland projects. WMA Roving Crews (approximately 24,000 acres over 3 years) - $1,581,200WMA Roving Crews have proven to be an effective means to accomplish supplemental habitat work. We currently have three WMA Roving Crews working in Minnesota funded through four seperate Outdoor Heritage Fund appropriations (two grassland and two wetland appropriations). We propose funding for 75% (upland/prairie) of the DNR Region 1 Roving crew for four years.

Projects are prioritized based on ecological benefit, urgency, feasibility, and stakeholder support.","Minnesota may be the Land of 10,000 lakes, but often overlooked are its over 69,000 miles of streams. From small trout streams to the mighty Mississippi, streams support a wealth of biodiversity and also provide excellent fishing opportunities. In some parts of the state that lack natural lakes, such as Southeast Minnesota and the Red River Valley, streams represent the only local opportunity for fishing. Trout, smallmouth bass, lake sturgeon, and walleye are among the species stream anglers can pursue.Minnesota streams host 162 fish species and 48 mussel species, of which 23 are listed as special concern, threatened or endangered. Streams in Minnesota have been degraded through a history of alterations to the streams themselves by channelization (straightening), poor riparian management, and fragmentation by barriers such as dams. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) works to restore or enhance habitat to address these impacts, benefiting fish, mussels, and other aquatic life. However, department resources for stream habitat work fall far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department. In past rounds of OHF, stream habitat has been part of a larger MNDNR package of aquatic habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement projects. In this round we have chosen to create a proposal focused solely on stream restoration and enhancement, with aquatic habitat protection in a separate proposal.One of the biggest limitations to fish and mussel species is the fragmentation of rivers. Dams and other obstructions block fish from migrating to key habitats such as spawning areas. The juvenile life stage of mussels spends it's first weeks of life on the gills of a fish, and relies on that fish to transport it upstream to hospitable habitats. Barriers can lead to the loss of fish and mussel species above dams, and reduce populations living below them. Often dams and other barriers are not longer serving their intended function and can be removed. In cases where the dam is still functioning, the structure can be modified to allow fish passage. Examples of modifications include projects that have converted dams into rapids, and construction of nature-like fishways around or over dams.A case study in the benefits of fish passage is the removal of a dam on the Pomme de Terre River in Appleton, MN. Following removal, 10 fish species including walleye and channel catfish have returned to 42 upstream miles of river that became accessible. Mussel species have also benefited, with two native mussel species now found in areas upstream of the dam where formerly they had been absent. Another example is the modification of the Heidberg Dam on the Wild Rice River to allow fish passage, where 10 fish species including walleye, sauger, channel catfish, and smallmouth bass are now found where they had formerly been absent, as far as 75 miles upstream of the dam. These case studies show that although the footprint of fish passage projects is small (typically only a few acres) and the cost per acre appears high, the benefits go far beyond the project site. We can impact miles of stream in a single project, and the benefits will endure.Some proposed fish passage projects target species living in lakes that use streams for spawning. Many species including northern pike, walleye, suckers, and numerous minnow species migrate out of lakes and into streams to spawn before returning to the lake. On many lakes, the outlet has been dammed in order to stabilize water levels for property owners. These dams block fish from returning to the lake when they've finished spawning, as well as blocking their offspring from migrating to the lake when they mature.The potential for fish passage projects to enable access by invasive species has been examined for all proposed projects. None of these projects serve as a barrier between problem species such as Invasive Carp and upstream waters. Most aquatic invasive species (e.g. zebra mussels or Eurasian water milfoil) rely on other vectors such as unintentional transport by recreational boaters, rather than swimming upstream past barriers.Many streams in Minnesota have also been degraded by habitat alteration such as channelization (straightening). This simplifies the habitat and eliminates the shallow riffles and deeper pools that are required by different life stages of fish. Other streams have issues with bank erosion that degrade habitat. Channel restoration and enhancement projects can address these impacts by recreating appropriate habitat, and stabilizing eroding banks. This benefits not only the project area, but reaches that lie downstream that are no longer affected by eroded sediment.Our package of fish passage and stream channel restoration and enhancement includes 7 projects that occur in 4 of 5 LSOHC planning regions. Although the footprint of projects is 22 acres, the projects will benefit over 4,400 acres of lakes and streams (refer to Table 1) through restoration or enhancement of fish passage. Projects were selected from a prioritized list that includes factors such as ecological benefit, feasibility, urgency, and stakeholder support. We have chosen to include parcels in this proposal above and beyond what can be accomplished with allocated funds. This will allow flexibility to complete additional projects should new sources of matching funds become available.Several of the projects on our parcel list (e.g. the Adrian Dam, and Cottonwood River dams) will involve partnership with other state agencies or local governments. Partners in many cases are local governments that own a dam proposed for removal or modification. In all cases local partners are supportive of the project, and will contribute in-kind staff time toward the projects' completion. This request also funds an ongoing stream habitat coordinator position and a part-time intern for two years. The increased work of coordinating complex stream projects funded by OHF is greater than can be handled by existing MNDNR staff.

Though the actual footprint of fish passage projects is relatively small, these projects will reconnect over 600 acres of lake and river habitat. Stream projects were selected from a statewide list, prioritized by factors such as ecological benefit, scale of impact, urgency of completion, and local support.","The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MNDNR) annually updates a statewide list of stream habitat projects. Project submittals come both from MNDNR staff and from partner organizations. Projects are prioritized based on scale-of-impact, urgency, local support, and critical habitat for rare species. Based on this list, MNDNR and our partners are proposing two fish passage projects and two channel restorations, leveraging a confirmed $463,400 and an additional $1,000,000 requested from other sources. Access to diverse habitats is critical for fish and other aquatic organisms to complete various life stages. The habitats they use at different life stages may all vary widely. These habitats can be fairly unique, such as high-gradient riffles favored by many spawning fish, and may be miles apart. When dams or other obstructions prevent aquatic life from reaching ideal habitat, they are forced to use less optimal locations that can reduce their success. In some cases this leads to the complete loss of sensitive species upstream of a barrier. Modifying or removing the barriers through our two proposed fish passage projects would have a total footprint of 2 acres, but create upstream access to over 600 acres of lake and river habitat. This will benefit fish such as walleye and brook trout present in these rivers, as well as five mussel species classified as threatened or special concern. Streams naturally form habitat through the meandering of the river. Deeper, slower habitat is created by scour into the bed of the river around the outside of bends, while faster water and a rockier bottom is found in the straight sections in between. Wood, overhanging vegetation, and boulders serve as cover and current breaks for fish. In degraded sections of river, these natural processes are disrupted. Some reaches have been artificially straightened, preventing the meandering that forms diverse habitat. In other places, streams have become surrounded by tall banks that prevent high flows from spilling out onto a floodplain. When floods are trapped within the stream channel, the river erodes the banks. This not only mobilizes tons of sediment that degrades downstream habitat, but results in a wide, shallow channel during low-flow periods that is avoided by adult fish. Channel restoration projects will utilize reference locations with high-quality habitat to improve habitat. Working with partners, we will restore 1.8 miles of habitat on two streams. Department resources for stream habitat work falls far short of the need; funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) has been critical to an acceleration of stream habitat work by the department and partners such as Trout Unlimited, as well as smaller groups such as lake associations.

Water quality, especially nitrate contamination, is a human health and wildlife issue. Restoring and enhancing grasslands are one of the most effective ways to improve all of these issues. Because of the losses of grassland and wetland habitat across western Minnesota both historically and in recent years, it is that much more important that the public grasslands in Minnesota are as productive as possible for wildlife and pollinators.

This should in turn increase native plant diversity and increase pollinator habitat.   One area new for this appropriation is conservation grazing, although in this case much of it could be referred to as conservation browsing.  Goats were used in some cases for grazing prairie, especially on steep slopes.  These areas are often dangerous for equipment and the goats reduce reliance on chemicals.  Below is one description from DNR staff of this type of project.   ""At Mound Prairie SNA, west of Hokah, MN, goats have spent multiple seasons grazing two bluff prairies cleared of eastern red cedar trees and invasive brush, such as buckthorn and honeysuckle.  The goats were able to reduce the vigor of the woody vegetation, allowing native grasses and forbs an opportunity to grow.  Using goats reduced the amount of chemical needed to control the invasive woody brush! There is now a sufficient grass component to facilitate prescribed burning.""       A similar project in central Minnesota shows the benefits of cedar removal to prairie plants and wildlife.    ""Starting in 2016 and continuing into 2019 invading trees and brush were removed from about 25 acres of rock outcrop and wet prairie at Cedar Rock SNA in Redwood County.  The work was done in two phases; first large trees (mostly cedar) were cut, treated, piled and burned.  Two years later a follow-up pass was made to control buckthorn which had grown after the removal of the taller trees.  Although formal post-treatment surveys have not been conducted; previously undocumented rare plants are apparent and the area appears to harbor a broad array of both plant and animal species."" One area that gets little attention in habitat work is the ecosystem benefits of that work.  Again, numerous studies have shown that grassland restoration is a very good way to remove carbon from the air, helping to mitigate climate change.  Even prescribed burning, because it stimulates root growth will help remove carbon from the air and store the carbon in the soil.   As always, monitoring continues to be an issue with all these projects, both at the individual site and the larger landscape.  The conservation partners in the state, including DNR, FWS, TNC, and others, continue to work to develop statistically rigorous ways of addressing these questions.   Attached are a series of images from Mound Prairie SNA (word doc) and Cedar Rock SNA (indiv jpgs).  The Mound Prairie images show the impacts of cedar removal in the SE.  The Cedar Rock aerial images show how cedars were only scattered over the site in the 1930s, covered the site before this project, and how these funds help open up a large area to prairie.   For this final report, dollars for each project are pro-rated based on the acre percentage for each project relative to the budget.   ",2014-07-01,2019-10-31,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,"Greg ",Hoch,"DNR Wildlife","500 Lafayette Rd ","St. Paul",MN,55155,"(651) 259-5230",greg.hoch@state.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Anoka, Becker, Beltrami, Big Stone, Blue Earth, Clay, Clearwater, Crow Wing, Dakota, Douglas, Faribault, Fillmore, Goodhue, Grant, Houston, Kanabec, Kandiyohi, Kittson, Lac qui Parle, Le Sueur, Lyon, Mahnomen, Marshall, McLeod, Meeker, Norman, Olmsted, Otter Tail, Pine, Pope, Red Lake, Redwood, Rice, Scott, Sherburne, Sibley, Stevens, Swift, Todd, Traverse, Wabasha, Wadena, Washington, Wilkin, Winona, Yellow Medicine","Forest Prairie Transition, Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/dnr-grassland-phase-vi,,,,

Although there are many competent professionals working in the field, the quality of work varies across the profession and lack of expertise contributes to failures, partly because there is currently a lack of professional restoration training available. In order to help improve the success rates of restorations, scientists and educators at the University of Minnesota's Department of Horticultural Science are using this appropriation to develop an ecological restoration education program and cooperative. The effort will make training opportunities for practicing restoration professionals available statewide and facilitate improved and increased communication amongst the restoration community. OVERALL PROJECT OUTCOME AND RESULTS Ecological restoration is increasingly relied on as a conservation strategy in Minnesota even though project failure rates remain high. To improve ecological restoration success in Minnesota, this project developed training opportunities for practicing restoration professionals. We established the Ecological Restoration Training Cooperative (ERTC), which is based at the University of Minnesota, and coordinated as a partnership between state agencies and the University. A program of web-based, instructor-guided learning, combined with field sessions offered at multiple locations, are the first of its kind in the US for restoration. As part of this project, the training cooperative developed and offered five application-oriented online courses accessible statewide. These courses covering site assessment, seeding, planting, vegetation management and monitoring, were taken by 113 people during the ""pilot phase"". Each course will be offered at least twice a year through the U of MN College of Continuing Education. In conjunction with the online courses, field training sessions were developed for the seeding and vegetation management courses. These sessions focus on hands-on restoration skills introduced in the online courses. A four-year agreement with DNR Parks and Trails will allow each of the two field sessions to be taught by DNR natural resource specialists at four out-state locations each year in order to facilitate access to the training opportunities by individuals from around the state. In addition to the five training courses, the ERTC developed several other ways for restoration practitioners to learn skills and stay current. A webinar series, an annual workshop, social network, and website were all launched as part of ERTIC programming. During this grant period, five webinars were held, which were attended by over 1000 people. These presentations were recorded and are available on the practitioner's network, which has 187 members to date. The first annual conference, focused on restoration monitoring, was held in May 2013. Information on all upcoming events, including online courses can be found on the ERTC website, www.restoringminnesota.umn.edu. Details about the content of online courses, field sessions, webinars, and the workshop are presented in a supplemental report. PROJECT RESULTS USE AND DISSEMINATIONInformation from this project has been made available in the following ways:Information on training opportunities is made available through the ERTC website, which was accessed over 2600 times in the past 18 months.Recorded webinar presentations are available through the ERTC practitioner's network, which is also linked to the website.Course and workshop information has been (and will continue to be) disseminated to over 6000 people, which is part of an active marketing effort led by the College of Continuing Education.The innovative approaches taken to the online courses have been communicated by press-releases connected to the R1Edu national university network.The innovative suite of training opportunities will be communicated with restoration researchers and practitioners at a talk to presented to the Society for Ecological Restoration International Congress to be held in October 2013.Of the 140 people that completed the course as beta-testers or in the pilot phase, many were middle-level managers responsible for contracting and program coordination. These individuals have first-hand experience with the course and are in a position to recommend it to colleagues that need/want to advance their skills.

","Greater than 95% of Minnesota’s prairies have been lost to the plow and development. Many of the remaining acres of native and restored grasslands have been degraded from lack of fire and spread of invasive trees. Many wetlands are now in need of repair while others can be enhanced or restored. This project aims to address the loss of productivity on WPAs, WMAs, and NWRs that are open to hunting so they can reach their full potential for wildlife production. Research has shown that trees are detrimental to prairie/grassland wildlife and will be removed with this proposal. Common species that degrade this habitat include but are not limited to Siberian Elm, Box Elder, and Eastern Red Cedar. The trees provide perches for avian predators such as red-tailed hawks, great-horned owls, and crows, and dens for red fox, raccoon, and skunk. Predators like these are highly effective at predating both nests and nesting birds, especially in fragmented habitat. Wetlands will be restored/enhanced by removing drain tile, and constructing/repairing earthen dams and/or water control structures. Wetlands targeted for enhancement are vital to providing food, cover, and space required for breeding waterfowl and are essential to water quality and aquifer recharge.Research has shown that a diverse mixture of native grasses and forbs is ideal for nesting and brood rearing of upland nesting birds along with being essential for pollinator species. Many WMAs, WPAs, or NWRs were purchased in sub-optimal habitat condition (e.g. monotype of brome grass) or were restored using low diversity seed mixes that are less productive for wildlife. We will use a site-specific combination of techniques (e.g. cultivation, tree removal, herbicide, and prescribed fire) to bring back productivity to these public lands. In close collaboration with the land managers, we will seed a diverse mix of native grasses and forbs that are well adapted to site conditions.

Habitat will be enhanced through tree removal, prescribed fire, diversity seeding, conservation grazing, brush mowing, and shearing. Enhancements will take place on permanently protected lands open to public hunting including Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs), state forest lands, and county-owned lands.","The sharp-tailed grouse was once common on Minnesota’s open and brushland habitats. However, the loss of habitat to cropland, tree plantations and natural succession, have significantly decreased the acreage of suitable habitat for sharp-tailed grouse and other early successional habitat dependent species. A long-term decline in sharp-tailed grouse populations has caused them to be listed as a Minnesota species of greatest conservation need. In the Northern Forest Region of Minnesota, activities that enhance and restore open landscapes such as prescribed fire, mowing and shearing, tree removal, diversity seeding, and conservation grazing will be implemented to ensure our public lands are reaching their full potential for wildlife habitat. Prescribed fire is the primary management tool for managing or creating early successional habitat where conditions are appropriate. Prescribed fire increases vigor, sets back natural succession of woody species, and removes built up residue.In some cases where fire is not possible due to site conditions or type of vegetation, mowing and shearing of small diameter brush and trees will be used. In areas with larger trees that cannot be burned or mowed, tree removal will be done. Tree removal will not occur in areas where timber harvest would be marketable because most projects are too small to make them profitable for logging and/or are removing smaller undesirable trees and brush. We will use a site-specific combination of techniques (e.g. cultivation, tree removal, herbicide, and prescribed fire) to bring back productivity to these public lands.

As we lose habitat to conversion and encroachment, it is increasingly important to maximize wildlife production on existing permanently protected lands. Today's public lands are expected to function at the highest level for not only wildlife usability but now also for other non game rare and threatened species, pollinators, and for water quality efforts in the state. To meet today's expectations, public lands need to be enhanced from their original cover type which could have been planted with different priorities then today's. This program was developed in cooperation with the MNDNR and USFWS with the goals of developing higher quality biologically significant habitat that provide maximum usability by wildlife, pollinators, and non game species alike. PF, in cooperation with the MNDNR and USFWS, was able to contract out and enhance 21,553 acres of permanently protected public lands within this grant, which exceeded the proposed acres by 3,053 acres. PF was able to exceed the acre goal with less money than anticipated, spending only $1,308,000 of the allocated $1,320,000. Additionally PF came in under budget for personnel costs only spending $40,300. Because of the efficiency and high level of collaboration at which PF operates we are able to deliver high quality habitat enhancements at a lower than anticipated cost.This completed program enhanced 21,553 acres of permanently protected habitat and 1,148 acres of native prairie.",,"Greater than 95% of Minnesota’s prairies have been lost to the plow and development. Many of the remaining acres of native and restored grasslands have been degraded from lack of fire and the spread of invasive volunteer trees. Many of these acres have low plant diversity and are not reaching their potential for wildlife production. Many older public hunting areas were purchased as brome fields or were restored using low diversity seed mixes. As mentioned above, today's expectations of habitat cover on public lands have changed. We are demanding public lands function at a higher level for many reasons. In 1972 a Wildlife Biologist, Barnet Schranck, once said “The days for setting lands aside to be left idle for wildlife are past, and management techniques are needed to keep habitat in the more vigorous, earlier stages of ecological succession”. Here 45 years later we are facing the exact same problems, however, we have significantly less ‘idle’ lands putting more pressure on permanently protected lands to be as productive as possible. As biology advances, we understand that we need to attempt to replicate the diversity as seen in native prairies when feasible to be able to have a chance to sustain wildlife that depend on this diversity. For the sites needing a higher diversity of forbs and grasses, we used a mix of cultivation, herbicide and prescribed fire to prep the site and plant with a high diversity native grass and forb mix. Other sites may have had a good grass and forb base already but needed a prescribed fire to remove the duff layer, set back non-native grasses and to promote forb expression. Prescribed burning is a great tool for enhancing grassland habitat for waterfowl, gamebirds, and songbirds. Prescribed fire usually was conducted in the spring after the non-native grasses started growing which would set back these undesirable species giving native species a leg up. Invasive tree removal was done mechanically by using heavy equipment to cut, treat, and pile woody debris to be burned at a later date. Special considerations were taken to reduce rutting and the spread of invasive species from different sites. Tree removal was often done in the winter months when the ground is frozen. This appropriation has allowed the DNR and USFWS to enhance public lands (i.e. DNR Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) and USFWS Waterfowl Production Areas (WPA)) to the new expectation the public desires. All sites were enhanced following recommendations and by working in close collaboration with the area wildlife managers. As you will see in the attachment labeled 'project list', projects were bundled together based on activity type and location in order to get the lowest possible price. For this reason most projects in bundles do not have a per tract cost, but instead a total cost for all projects in that specific bundle. To calculate the per project cost in the parcel tab we took the total bundle price and averaged it by the number of projects in that bid bundle. A few projects in the attached 'project list' show 0 acres because these same project acres were already counted within this proposal within another activity category. It is also apparent in our attached project list that some per project costs are much lower than others within the same enhancement category. These project costs differ for various reasons. One reason being that the number of woody species on the tree removal sites can vary greatly. For example, on a tract enhanced through tree removal there can be scattered removal of encroaching trees or there could be the removal of heavily wooded areas such as old building sites or larger cottonwoods surrounding a wetland. Costs vary on diversity seedings because in some cases we were able to get match from the USFWS to help lower project costs. Our goal was to get good work done at the most economical price. The average cost of enhancement in this appropriation was approximately $61.00 per acre which we feel is a great price and provides a lot of value for the money. Swan Lake Waterfowl Production Area is a good example of how funds were used to help achieve management goals. Funds were used to remove undesirable woody vegetation from grassland habitat for migratory birds. Tree removal simulates conditions that existed here before European settlement. At that time, the land was predominantly treeless due to landscape scale prairie fires, so the goal is to recreate those conditions. Swan Lake WPA was infested with undesirable woody vegetation which diminishes the habitat value of the surrounding restored and native grasslands. This tree removal project targeted the undesirable trees invading these grasslands and wetlands. Funds were spent to hire a contractor to remove and chemically treat undesired deciduous and coniferous trees and to pile trees within selected locations on the WPA. The purpose of clearing trees and understory of brush is to restore the original grassland plants and the threatened grassland dependent fauna. Trees were removed by pulling or cutting, cut stumps were treated with an herbicide. 1,148 acres of native prairie was enhanced using prescribed fire in this appropriation. Fire is critical to maintain diversity and disturbance regimes on native prairie sites to keep these ares from becoming overtaken by non-native, more aggressive grass and weed species. Native prairie was identified using MNDNR MCBS native plant communities geospatial layer and historic areal imagery. It is important to continue to periodically enhance native prairie by prescribed fire to keep these areas functioning at the highest level possible as they often support rare, threatened and endangered species that depend on high quality native prairie. PF used the approved Request for Proposal (RFP) process to solicit contractors and CCM crews to conduct enhancements on lands open to public hunting owned and managed by the DNR and USFWS. PF in collaboration with our local chapter network requested projects from every USFWS and MNDNR office within the priority area. Projects were considered based on location, type of enhancement, and other geospatial factors such as proximity to rare species, native prairie, wellhead protection areas, etc. Consideration was also given to projects within core areas of the MN Prairie Conservation Plan. We were able to “bundle” many projects into one contract (as shown in attached project list) which added to our efficiency and effectiveness. The effectiveness of PF's RFP process can be measured by the fact that PF over delivered on acres while coming in under budget as broken out in the output tables.

Many of the remaining acres of native and restored grasslands have been degraded from lack of fire and the spread of invasive trees. Many of these acres have low plant diversity and aren't reaching their potential for wildlife production.Research from across the tallgrass prairie region has shown that trees are almost always detrimental to prairie/grassland wildlife, for several reasons. Tree branches provide perches for hawks, owls, crows, and magpies, while the bases of the trees provide dens for foxes, raccoons, skunks, all of which can prey on eggs or nesting hens.Wetlands will be restored or enhanced by constructing low, earthen dams (some with water control structures) or removing drainage tiles. Many public hunting areas were purchased as brome fields or were restored using low diversity seed mixes, often only grasses. At these sites, we will use a mix of cultivation, herbicide and prescribed fire to prep the site and plant with a high diversity native grasses and forbs.Prescribed burning is the primary management tool for managing grassland habitat for waterfowl, gamebirds, and songbirds. This project will increase capabilities of DNR and USFWS to conduct prescribed fires on public lands, including DNR Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) and USFWS Waterfowl Production Areas (WPA).

",,"Projects supported by LSOHC surfaced many innovative strategies for engaging citizens that have either historically been considered “disengaged” with traditional AIS prevention messaging (wakeboarders), are potentially “influencers” (teenagers that are both future recreationalists, and also highly effective at bugging their parents to engage in best AIS prevention practices), and users that recognize and value AIS prevention messages but have been too busy or cognizant of counter-veiling economic pressures (resort owners and tourism boosters). In the first two examples, we have no doubt that the videos produced by the Mississippi Headwaters Board to reach wakeboarders or the “Wipe Out Invasive Species” toilet paper (developed using private funds) which was part of the CROW programming were clever, reached new audiences, and changed knowledge, even if changes in behavior are difficult to document.  In contrast, the partnership on Lake Vermillion, Cass and Itasca Counties linked education (to resort owners and their guests) with direct action (sponsoring resort staff to help with inspections, etc.) and not only changed knowledge and behavior, but also forged lasting relationships between constituencies that have not always seen common interest.  The two “CD3” projects (hosted by Wildlife Forever) were somewhere between these examples – they explored innovative ideas (use of geo-fencing to deliver location specific information on fishing conditions and AIS risk or best practices; Wi-Fi stations to support videos at points of access or decontamination) and identified barriers. The self-contained boat cleaning stations now reflect designs most likely to be used, most resistant to vandalism and damage, and at a cost that local units of government and/or private resorts could consider deploying them without future state support.  Aitkin Soil and Water Conservation District addressed a recent and unpopular caveat of Minnesota law requiring the dumping of bait and prohibition on the transport of water on exit from a lake. They incentivized bait shops and fishermen by providing clean water in bags to save bait. In Cass County, AIS inspectors received “enhanced training” to equip them with knowledge and context for why inspections and decontamination are required, and in de-escalation techniques to manage conflicts with public access users. In addition to improving the quality of interactions inspectors had with access users, the County also found that they retained veteran, skilled inspectors that received enhanced training at a much greater rate, saving time and money. Five projects involved direct treatment of known aquatic invasive species (as a strategy to prevent spread to other waters), and each contributed significantly to greater knowledge and should inform future work or investments in this type of approach.  The Marine-Carnelian Watershed District has struggled with cost, ecological impact, and efficacy of treating Eurasian watermilfoil. Their pilot project (developed in close coordination with DNR Fisheries staff) resulted in several years of data that suggest that they have identified that split application of aquatic herbicide is highly effective at reducing EWM reproduction or spread and has fewer non-target impacts.  Two other treatment examples (of invasive cattails in Voyageurs National Park and Starry Stonewort in Lake Koronis) were pilot efforts to control species not previously successfully managed in the upper Midwest. The Koronis effort (as the first confirmed location of Starry Stonewort in Minnesota) has resulted in refined treatment of this invasive filamentous algae (even more important now that it has spread to over a dozen additional lakes within our state). Like the Vermillion/Cass/Itasca project, the Voyageurs project helped create or deepen relationships (with an adjacent Tribal nation).  The fourth effort of treatment was intense mechanical treatment at public landings in Carver County (in lakes with known infestations of invasive species) with the goal of reducing export of viable AIS. This program provided “inconclusive results” -- reducing vegetation near public accesses did not seem to impact the amount of vegetation (whether native or invasive) on boats exiting the lake.  An effort by the Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District to trap rusty crawfish in areas immediately adjacent to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness proved less successful as weather conditions, existing crawfish populations, and staff availability hindered ability to trap sufficient crustaceans to impact overall populations. Their crawfish boils, however, were very popular and an excellent educational vehicle. Efforts to improve the convenience or ease, cost, or efficacy of inspection and decontamination programs were the most difficult to assess. The Carver County effort to “tag” clean boats was intended to expedite re-entry, but DNR staff quickly expressed concerns about the quality of inspections and requested suspension of the effort.  Kandiyohi County sought to improve the speed and convenience of inspection by allowing for “reservations” (similar to a restaurant) so that recreationalists could be “in and out” quickly. Although this idea continues to hold appeal, limited marketing of the service, greater cost than anticipated, and turnover of paid county staff and of the County Board resulted in early termination without ever fully testing the concept.  At Lake Vermillion an effort was made to improve the accuracy of boat traffic prediction as a strategy to most cost-effectively allocate AIS inspection resources, but a primary conclusion was that boat traffic patterns vary so much (based on multiple variables) that a single algorithm or model is of limited value. Wright County attempted to explore the benefits and concerns associated with the first-in-Minnesota mandatory inspection program (similar to those in many western states), but found that the project experienced both regulatory barriers (particularly to scale the project so that is was cost-effective) and political opposition created a climate where the project proponents felt the idea was never given an opportunity to succeed. The Initiative Foundation recognized this strategy would generate controversy but hoped it would identify conditions in which it could be successful, even if modifications were required over time. The Citizens League’s Civic Governance Project’s project to increase coordination and collaboration between state/local governments and stakeholder groups revealed that a focus on Civic Leadership Development, while slow, is more sustainable than a simple civic engagement strategy.

The plan will benefit fish, waterfowl and other wildlife species as well as provide educational opportunities for the community. ","The Fairmont Chain of Lakes are positioned within the heart of the City of Fairmont, appropriately nicknamed The City of Lakes. The five lakes flow from South to North and are all connected by streams and channels. Fairmont has a population of 10,000 and is the County Seat of Martin County which has a population of 20,000. Martin County has 49 named lakes and 20 + unnamed lakes. The lakes are used for recreation, with the most popular activities being hunting and fishing. The Fairmont Chain of Lakes are the most popular lakes for recreation and are critical to the local economy. The City of Fairmont is partnering with Martin Soil and Water Conservation District, The Fairmont Lakes Foundation, DNR Fish and Wildlife, and the Martin County Conservation Alliance to restore and reconnect two floodplain wetlands along Dutch Creek, which flows into the Fairmont Chain of Lakes. The basins will be restored with adjustable wetland hydrology and seeding with native wetland vegetation. The upland areas will be seeded with native prairie plant species, including local source ecotype, to benefit pollinator species. A diversion weir and cross vanes allowing for fish passage will be installed in the Creek to divert flow into the wetland basins. This will allow for adjustable water levels within the wetland to ensure Northern Pike are able to spawn and to exclude Carp access and spawning.The project will provide the largest, highest quality spawning habitat within the Fairmont Chain of Lakes Watershed. Previously usable spawning habitat has been degraded due to development, drainage and loss of connectivity of the floodplain wetlands to the Chain of Lakes. Due to loss and degradation of suitable spawning habitat, the Fairmont Chain of Lakes has had a significant decrease in the Northern Pike (Apex Predator) population. This has allowed the Invasive Carp and Yellow Bass populations to grow rapidly. This shallow lake system, located in Southern Minnesota, is a critical part of the Fairmont economy and is a place where many in Martin County, and the region, go to recreate. The fishery has been in decline as it has lost its balance without a healthy Northern Pike population. The DNR would like to improve habitat for native species, and the Northern Pike.By restoring and reconnecting the floodplain wetlands with the stream and lake, the primary benefit will be the restoration of critical Northern Pike spawning habitat. Intentionally, there will be a host of secondary benefits to restoring these wetlands. Martin County has a heavily studied population of the Blanding’s Turtle, which is on the State’s Rare and Threatened Species Lists.

These forests and mixed wetlands cover thousands of acres and are critical to many species of birds and otherwildlife, including wood ducks, which use these areas for nesting and feeding.While historically diverse in the number, age, and size of tree species, much of the forest now consists of silver maple ranging from 50-70 years old. These trees are expected to live another 50-70+ years, after which they will die naturally. Unfortunately, when trees arelost, reed canary grass and other invasive species move in and prevent natural regeneration. This is occurring throughout the projectarea, and without aggressive, long-term management these floodplain forests will decline or in some locations disappear completely.Floodplain forest regeneration is a slow process taking decades to accomplish. By selectively controlling invasive species andregenerating trees the forest can be maintained long-term.

These forests, which provide critical habitat for forest dependent birds, are under threat from invasive species like reed canary grass. Without active management these forests will continue to decline over time. Our program focused on controlling invasive species and regenerating a variety of tree and shrub species. We prepared sites for planting or natural regeneration using herbicide, disking, or mowing; planted tree seedlings, cottonwood cuttings, or direct seeded; protected trees from deer and voles; improved tree vigor and growth through selective thinning; and controlled weeds (herbicide, mowing) after planting. Our geographic scope included the Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border, and the lower ends of major tributaries. Much of this area included state forest, Wildlife Management Areas, or National Wildlife and Fish Refuge lands. Our priorities were determined in cooperation with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and US Army Corps of Engineers. All projects were on public lands owned and managed by these agencies. Priorities were based on forest condition and threats, habitat needs, logistics, and access. Our goal was to prevent or control invasive species long enough to establish forest canopy and maintain a diverse forest structure that benefits birds and other wildlife. Our objectives were designed to utilize a variety of enhancement tools, monitor results, and apply that information to designing new projects. A description of each project is provided below. For several sites additional work will be completed with Phase 2 of our floodplain forest enhancement program. At Gores WMA, a 20-acre site north of Red Wing, we completed site preparation, planted bare root seedlings on 10 acres, and completed post planting weed control following tree planting on 10 additional acres that had been previously planted by US Army Corps of Engineers. At the Cannon River Collischan Road Willow Project, a 10-acre site near Red Wing, we treated reed canary grass and cut willow trees along strips to encourage aggressive expansion of willows to prevent reed canary grass encroachment into adjacent high quality floodplain forest. At Dukes Pond, a 22-acre site near Red Wing, we completed site preparation on 15 acres along the edge of existing high quality floodplain forest. Our intention was to plant trees the next fall on the treated area, but unusually high water prevented this from occurring. Bare root seedlings and potted trees had been purchased, so instead of planting the treated areas we planted 7 adjacent acres where DNR Forestry was planning a timber harvest. The planted trees will regenerate when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At North Clear Lake, a 9-acre site north of Red Wing, bare root seedlings were planted in the understory of existing floodplain forest scheduled for harvest by DNR Forestry. The planted trees will give a head start to regeneration when the canopy opens up following harvest, and before reed canary grass can become established. At East Indian Creek Delta, a 55-acre site north of Weaver, site preparation was completed and tree and shrub seedlings were planted in an area dominated by ash trees. Shade tolerant seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to the death and decline of older trees. At Whitewater Delta, a 51-acre site near Weaver, buckthorn was removed and bare root seedlings and potted trees were planted in an area dominated by ash trees with pockets of reed canary grass. The seedlings will grow when the canopy opens up due to emerald ash borer impacts on the exiting trees. At Whalen Tract, a 55-acre site just north of the Iowa border, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, and post planting weed control. At Whitewater DNR, a 16-acre site approximately 5 miles upstream of the mouth of the Whitewater River, site preparation and direct seeding were completed. At Cannon River Bottoms State Forest, a 30-acre site near Red Wing, site preparation was completed and tree seedlings and potted trees were planted in open pockets of reed canary grass within existing forest scheduled for harvest. At Root River, a 93-acre site near La Crescent, a variety of activities were completed including site preparation, tree planting, cottonwood cuttings, direct seeding, and post planting weed control. At four of the above sites (Cannon River Collischan Road Willow project, Whitewater DNR, Root River, Whalen Tract) up to 8 acres within or near each site was also treated for reed canary grass and planted with different tree species and stock types. This was part of a LCCMR study evaluating reed canary grass control, and tree survival and growth. Evaluating success will take time. Because trees are slow growing, it can take a decade or longer for them to grow large enough to form a canopy, which will ultimately determine the success of these projects. Preliminary findings indicate initial survival of seedlings was variable. At some sites, post planting observations suggest low survival, however, small seedlings are difficult to locate in the forest understory. First year survival of bare root seedlings at the LCCMR study sites was 80-90%. Survival of potted trees at many sites was good, however there was some damage from deer. Other findings resulting from this grant included: post tree planting weed control and maintenance is essential for tree seedling survival; tree guards and deer repellent are effective at protecting trees from deer and voles; cottonwood cuttings were relatively easy to install and effective at establishing trees; swamp white oak were resilient, relatively fast growing, and resistant to deer browse making them a good choice for these sites; plantings on drier sites, with proper maintenance, take less time to establish than wetter sites; good natural regeneration can occur on some sites after exposing mineral soils; and back-up sites are needed to adjust to flooding situations which may prevent scheduled tree plantings. These findings have been incorporated into project management prescriptions. ",2014-07-01,2019-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Tim,Schlagenhaft,"The National Audubon Society","2000 W.

This effort builds on previous LSOHC funding to control reed canary grass and plant trees as part of a long-term effort.","The Mississippi River from Hastings to the Iowa border contains some of the largest and most significant tracts of floodplain forest along the entire Upper Mississippi River. These forests and mixed wetlands cover tens of thousands of acres and are especially critical to many species of birds and other wildlife, including wood ducks which use these areas for nesting and feeding.These forests are under threat. While historically diverse in the number, age, and size of tree species, much of the forest now consists of silver maple ranging from 50-70 years old. These trees are expected to live another 50-70 years, after which they will die-off and disappear. Unfortunately, when trees are removed through harvest or die naturally, reed canary grass and other invasive species move in and prevent natural regeneration. This is occurring at a number of locations within the project area, and without aggressive, long-term management these floodplain forests will be greatly reduced or in some locations disappear completely. Floodplain forest regeneration is a slow process taking decades to accomplish. By selectively controlling invasive species following harvest, blowdown, or other events and planting trees the forest can be maintained long-term. Restoring forest at small sites within larger tracts will ensure that a diversity of tree species, sizes, and ages are present. This approach over time will maintain large contiguous blocks of forest and continue to provide habitat for many wildlife species, including rare species like ceruleuan warbler and red-shouldered hawk.This proposal seeks funding to continue implementing floodplain forest restoration and enhancement projects throughout the project area which includes the Mississippi River and lower ends of major tributaries. The number of sites needing enhancement or restoration is extensive and will take many years of consistent work to restore. Sites identified in this proposal range from 20-115 acres in size. All sites are located on public lands within Minnesota state forests, WMA's, Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, or Corps of Engineers owned lands. Each site is threatened by invasive species and natural regeneration of floodplain forest trees is not expected without aggressive management. Funding will be used to control invasive species, especially reed canary grass, using a combination of prescribed burns, mowing or forestry mulching, and herbicide applications. Past efforts to plant seedlings into existing reed canary grass fields have not been successful, so once invasive species are controlled larger-size trees suitable to each site will be planted, or direct seeding or bare root trees may be used to create high densities of seedlings. At some sites, timber stand improvement including removing invasive species like buckthorn will be used to create small openings for diversifying forest species and age structure. Deer protection will be provided for planted trees when needed. Vole guards will be installed on the larger planted trees. This combination will allow the trees to establish and over time develop a canopy that limits or prevents invasive species and maintains the overall diversity of the forest.Priority sites were determined in conjunction with MN DNR, US Fish and Wildlife Service, and Corps of Engineers foresters and wildlife managers and are locations under serious threat of losing the floodplain forest. All of the sites are on public lands open to hunting and fishing. Three of the sites are listed with limited hunting access. These are within areas closed to waterfowl hunting on the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge. They are open to all legal hunting during other times of the year. Audubon Minnesota will serve as the project manager and coordinate the work and associated contracts. Much of the tree planting work will be done through Conservation Corps Minnesota. Audubon will work closely with state and federal managers to ensure all projects meet required standards and are part of the overall management goals for the landscape area.

Secondary benefits include additional protections of lands adjacent to the WMA and improved water quality and spring flood risk reduction downstream.","The Goose Prairie Marsh Enhancement project is located approximately 2 miles northeast of Hitterdal, MN in Goose Prairie Township, Clay County. The marsh is part of the Goose Prairie Wildlife Management Area (WMA). Clay County Ditch 18 (CD 18) was constructed through this area in about 1915. Water levels in Goose Prairie Marsh cannot currently be managed to improve wildlife habitat using the lake's natural outlet. Since the early 1990's the lake has been at historically high levels due to above average precipitation and constricted flow through the the historic outlet channel due to a buildup of sediment and cattails. These high water levels have resulted in substantially degraded habitat conditions in the marsh. This request for funding includes funds for two components of the Goose Prairie Marsh Enhancement project: installation of a water control structure and realignment of the outlet channel from the marsh to the water control structure (Attachment 1).1) Water control structure - A water control structure made of reinforced concrete with six, 5-foot stoplog bays will be constructed to allow water level manipulation between from 1203.6 and 1208.5 feet (NAVD 88). The water control structure will be located near the center of section 22, T141, R44 adjacent to 115th Ave N.

The new channel will effectively convey water from the marsh to the new outlet and ensure water level management and will avoid wetland impacts and habitat loss associated with cleaning out the existing channel (CD18). The channel is needed to improve water level management and it will also provide improved recreational access to the WMA.

The river's other designated uses also include recreation and aquatic life. Water quality monitoring conducted by local agencies discovered that the Thief River is not meeting state water quality standards for both turbidity (muddiness) and dissolved oxygen. Each year, approximately 12,376 tons of sediment is deposited into the Thief River Falls reservoir by the Thief River. That is the equivalent of over 1,200 dump trucks full of dirt. This excessive amount of sediment increases the potential of harmful byproducts getting into the city's drinking water, increases water treatment cost, and degrades the fish habitat.Marshall County Ditch 20 (CD20) is a drainage system that flows into the Thief River 7.5 miles northeast of Thief River Falls. The deepening of CD20 by erosion has been identified as a major contributor to the sedimentation problems in the Thief River and has exacerbated gully formation in fields along its course. Project partners will collaborate to implement grade stabilization and erosion control strategies along the lower 2.5 miles of CD20. Specifically, a series of rock riffle grade stabilization structures will be used to reduce the head cutting and sloughing along CD20 and side water inlets will be used to halt the gully erosion on adjacent field ditches. This project will help bring the Thief River closer to meeting the turbidity standard by reducing sediment on average by over 400 tons each year.

",,"This program incorporates the basic concepts of sustainability and ecosystem management. Minnesota has lost 99% of the original prairie and has seen dramatic declines in grassland dependent wildlife. Examples of the species showing the greatest conservation need in the Program area; the American Badger, Grasshopper Sparrow, and Bobolink to name just a few. Traditional game species are also affected by the decline in habitat such as pheasants, deer, wild turkey, and a variety of dabbling ducks which are associated to prairie wetland complexes.Publicly owned natural resource infrastructures (WMA, AMA, SNA, parks/trails, waterways) invigorates local and regional economies by providing outdoor recreation and tourism opportunities supported by hunting, fishing, wildlife observation areas, and other forms of outdoor recreation. New business concepts are likely to arise as a direct result of the recreational and tourism opportunities that will be advanced by this Green Corridor Legacy Program. Because of this concept there is wide support from many stakeholders who will assist the Program activities to achieve the desired outcomes.The Glacial River Warren created the Minnesota River Valley as it drained Lake Agassiz 10,000+ years ago. The bluff to bluff wall of water carved out one of Minnesota’s most scenic landscapes, creating unique geological features, and unique plant communities along the valley and its primary tributaries.Efforts to restore, protect, and enhance our wetlands, prairies, forests, and habitat for fish, game, and wildlife are timely as escalating development pressures threaten remaining natural lands and water resources on both public and private lands. The Green Corridor Legacy Program approach will be based on sound science concepts of plan development, setting conservation priorities, developing short and long term strategies to achieve conservation priorities, implement the strategies, and then continue monitoring the outcomes. All of these concepts and practices will follow existing state wildlife and conservation plans and natural resource management practices in conjunction with agency partners.The primary work area of the Green Corridor Legacy Program will be Redwood, Renville, Yellow Medicine, Chippewa, Brown, Nicollet, Murray, Lyon, and Cottonwood Counties with an emphasis along the Minnesota River, its tributaries, associated watersheds, and creating/expanding corridor or complexes of habitat. Connecting existing fragments of habitat along and near the Minnesota River and tributaries in the Program area will generate an ecological synergism that will allow game, wildlife, and aquatic species to flourish, while creating multiple recreational opportunities and improving public access through a series (phases) of funded activities within the nine (9) county Program area.This Program is directly consistent with the uses of the Outdoor Heritage Fund, as specified in Article XI of the Minnesota Constitution and Minnesota Statute 97A.056: to restore, protect, and enhance wetlands, prairies, forests, and habitat for fish, game, and wildlife. Furthermore, it will produce multiple conservation benefits across a large targeted and planned geographic area.Final Report: This program acquired 3 properties at total of 315 acres in our planned Lamberton area corridor that meets the above mentioned concepts and activities that produced multiple conservation benefits. 1) The Dutch Charleys Creek WMA project acquired 79 acres of which 39 acres where donated by the landowner at a value of $51,960. The property borders the eastern side of Dutch Charleys Creek and is a well documented wintering area for wildlife like deer, turkey, and pheasants. This property also connects to a FY10 OHF Green Corridor project of 83 acres. 2) Gora Praire WMA is 154 acre site that protected an expiring CRP contract and also protected small remnants of native prairie. 3) The Lamberton WMA #23 project of 80 acres of which 12 acres where donated by the landowner at a value of $16,000. This tract also protected an expiring CRP contract. This project also connects to a 90 acre FY11 OHF project by Green Corridor.This program year marked a time when land values were escalating and when many CRP contracts in the area were expiring. One high valued site of nearly 200 acres was pursued as part of this appropriation and after a tremendous amount of time/effort to work out details with the property owner no deal was reached.

",,"Through the Dakota County Land Conservation Program, the County has been protecting high-quality natural areas for wildlife habitat and improved water quality, outside its regional park system, since 2003. As with many conservation acquisition efforts during the term of this grant, modifications were made to accommodate evolving circumstances. As a result, Dakota County acquired only one conservation easement that protected 14 acres of: wetlands (8.4 acres); a small portion of Chub Creek (145 feet); and 5.5 acres of cropland restored to natural vegetation. The County's voluntary program can be unpredictable. An application round is held each year to accept submittals for potential conservation easement projects. Project Prioritization Criteria are used to score and rank project applications.  Some projects move through the process to closing, and some stall-out or are withdrawn for a variety of reasons.  It's strange that only project was completed during the acquisition phase of this grant; which is why in future grants, the County extended the window of time to complete acquisitions, because sometimes it just takes more time to get to the closing. An extended acquisition timeframe will provide greater flexibility in completing projects. Regarding restoration efforts, the County successfully restored 696 acres, involving 15 parcels. The County requires not only Natural Resource Management Plans (NRMPs) for each natural area easement, but requires that landowners sign a Management Agreement (MA) that outlines restoration and maintenance activities, who is responsible for the work, and how each activity will be funded, using cost estimates from accepted contractor proposals. Restoration work involved enhancement of 251 acres of parcels that include 7 miles of shoreline. Restoration activities included: restoring agricultural land to natural vegetation; removing of invasive species, like buckthorn; establishing test areas to determine the most effective way(s) to remove invasive species; and forest and prairie seeding to re-establish or enhance native species diversity. Significant habitat restoration and enhancement occurred at Whitetail Woods-Vermillion Highlands in the central part of Dakota County. The largest, highest quality natural area within the Vermillion River Corridor is Vermillion Highlands. The 437-acre Whitetail Woods-Vermillion Highlands Habitat Project site is owned by Dakota County and is part of a larger landscape of protected lands encompassing more than 4,000 acres, including the adjacent Vermillion River WMA and AMA, and the Vermillion Highlands Research, Recreation and Wildlife Managment Area. This project restored or enhanced the following habitat types at the site: • Prairie: 117 acres restored and 37 acres enhanced • Forest:  113 acres enhanced • Wetlands: 11 acres restored and 101 acres enhanced  This site currently supports populations of Blandings turtle, eagle, sandhill crane, deer, eastern cottontail, wild fur-bearing game (fox, coyote, mink, and beaver), wild turkey, pheasant, wood duck, and other waterfowl. Restoration and enhancement activities anticipate an increase in the populations of these and many other species, which will augment populations on the adjacent WMA and AMA areas. In addition, the project anticipates more diverse populations of non-game species. Baseline populations will be monitored.

A number of techniques were utilized to accomplish this work. Waterfowl habitat enhancements, over the period of this grant, were conducted on seven impoundments that are located throughout the reservation and covered approximately 300 acres. On these impoundments water levels were managed and dike and control structures were repaired and maintained. Beaver plugging is also an issue on many of these impoundment so dam material was removed as needed, Clemson Levelers were installed, and in some cases beaver removal was utilized to control the problem. Water draw downs were also accomplished on two impoundments to restore aquatic vegetation. A second aspect of this project was to enhance waterfowl food supply by planting wild rice. Wild rice has been degraded in some locations due to inappropriate water levels, damage from wind storms, and human activities. Two hundred acres of water was reseeded with rice during the course of this grant period. The third aspect of this project was to scan, and rectify the first seventeen years of aerial wild rice bed images that have been taken of major rice beds on the Reservation. A subset of this data was then analyzed and compared to waterfowl abundance data provided by the MN DNR to see if a positive correlation between rice abundance and waterfowl numbers could be identified. The work thus far completed has not been able to detect a significant relationship between rice abundance and waterfowl numbers, but we will continue this work on a larger data set looking at more parameters to see if one exists. The largest benefit from this work has been the development of the methodology to analyze rice distribution and abundance from aerial photographs that will be helpful for us and other resource personnel to manage wild rice into the future.

These areas are managed by the USFWS's Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District office. The primary objective was to restore small seasonal wetlands on WPAs. These small wetlands are important because they are the first to melt in the spring, providing critical habitat to early arriving migrating birds. Research has also shown that these types of wetlands have some of the highest invertebrate densities, a critical food source for egg-laying hens and fast-growing ducklings. These wetlands also play a role in flood protection in the Red River Valley. Because they are temporary or seasonal wetlands, they are often dry during the late fall. During snow melt the following spring, they are able to capture their full volume of water. Wetland restoration in western Minnesota is becoming increasingly important under several climate change models. First, these models predict increased flooding in the future. Second, the models predict that the climate of central Dakotas, the duck factory, will shift to western Minnesota. Wetland restoration in Minnesota buffers us against current and future flooding as well as the possible future waterfowl and songbird production in the Central Flyway.

Funds from the Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund were used to hire contractors to remove Eastern red cedar, buckthorn, honeysuckle, and prickly ash that was growing over former ""goat prairies"". The project focused primarily on improving habitat for the timber rattlesnake, three other at-risk snake species (racer, bullsnake, and hognose snake) and numerous at-risk plant species in the Bluffland subsection. Goat prairies are native prairies found on steep south-facing hills in southeastern Minnesota. They are important to wildlife because the wind prevents deep snowpack, and intense sunlight melts much of what does stick. Animals can then rest and forage on the exposed sites. Nearby rock bluffs hold snakes, which forage in the prairies in summer. These prairies were historically maintained by periodic wildfire, but fire prevention has allowed native red cedar and non-native brushy species to encroach on them. These need to be removed to restore the native habitat. Restoring vegetation through these methods also reduces soil loss and improves water quality within the watershed. During this grant period we treated 29.2 acres of habitat on private lands by hand cutting the invasive overstory. Stumps were treated with herbicides to prevent re-sprouting. Cut material was piled and burned on-site. A ten-year agreement was required from the landowners before any work began. The level of brush infestation, location and access impacted the contract price, which in turn led to lower than anticipated accomplishment acreage. The treatment area was 28 acres rather than the anticipated ""up to 45 acres"" as indicated in the initial plan. A second site was added later and an additional 1.2 acres treated. Periodic prescribed burning will be conducted by DNR (non-Trust-Fund monies) and will maintain the site in the desired habitat state.

Federal WPA's are managed for waterfowl production and are open to public hunting and other recreation consistent with the National Wildlife Refuge System. This restoration to the oak savannahs will create suitable habitat for deer, turkey, ruffed grouse, and other cavity nesting birds. Specifically, on the Winger WPA (Polk County Winger Township 147, Range 42, Section 2) we restored two oak savannahs for 35 acres by shearing and piling undesirable trees such as boxelder, cottonwood, willow, and aspen which opened the landscape to promote savannah habitat. Large and small oak trees were not cut and the seedlings were flagged to prevent accidental damage. All work was done in partnership with the USFWS Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District and other funds were secured and provided by the Minnesota Deer Hunters Association Hides for Habitat funds. Project Results Use and Dissemination MDHA has restored a total of two oak savannahs (35 acres total) on public land that is permanently protected and open to public hunting. These restored oak savannahs provide upland habitat for a variety of wildlife with a large scale benefit to hundreds of acres on the Winger WPA as well as the surrounding private land habitats. Future management of grasslands will be conducted by the USFWS Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District. Since this initial project was submitted, MDHA changed project managers from Phase IV. In phase V our funds from matching came mostly from the Hides for Habitat funds through MDHA which is why there are less ""other funds"" contributed to this Phase V work plan. MDHA strives to identify projects that capitalize on our chapter system and will improve on this into the future.

Through its Partners Program, the USFWS works with other federal and state agencies, local units of government, tribal entities, conservation organizations, and individual landowners to restore or enhance fish and wildlife habitats on private land. This program emphasizes restoring habitats and native vegetation for fish and wildlife in concert with the goals of individual private landowners. These projects also benefit the general public by providing habitat for fish, wildlife and plants, improving water quality and watershed health, reducing non-point source pollution, and creating opportunities for outdoor recreation and education. The $50,000.00 of Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF) funding obtained through this work program, accelerated the USFWS' existing Partners Program with an additional voluntary restoration or enhancement of 38 wetland basins covering 54 acres of wetland habitat and five grassland sites covering 491 acres of upland habitat. With this funding, a total of 6 projects were completed on private land within HCP Project Area 12. The ENRTF funds were expended from July 2009 through June 2011. The USFWS Partners Program provided $33,138.00 of Other Funds cost-sharing to complete these projects. The USFWS Partners Program also provided $13,400.00 of Other Funds to complete two additional upland enhancement projects totaling 43 acres. Under the Partners Program, wetlands are restored or enhanced by plugging or filling drainage ditches, removing excess sediment, breaking up sub-surface tile systems, embankment construction, and/or installing water control structures. Upland grassland areas are restored or enhanced by removing invasive woody vegetation and re-seeding former cropland to a native prairie seed mixture. All seeded areas complied with requirements to utilize local native ecotype seed as available. Project selection for ENRTF cost-share via the Partners Program is based on the project's contribution to building wetland and upland habitat complexes or corridors and/or restoring or enhancing native habitats in the focus project areas. Project Results Use and Dissemination These projects were completed within the nine HCP Project Areas across the state of Minnesota. Without the willingness of the landowners involved, and the variety of other partners, this important wetland, upland and river/riparian wildlife habitat would not be restored. Numerous presentations including information about ENRTF habitat restorations have been made over the past ten years at various meetings - i.e., Minnesota State Private Lands Meeting, the Wetland Summit, the Shallow Lakes Forum, MNDNR Roundtable, and at Kiwanis, Rotary, and Lion's Club presentations.

DU biologists and engineers provided technical assistance to Minnesota DNR, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and private landowners around shallow lakes with a goal of: Enhancing at least one shallow lake totaling 100 wetland acres with a new water control structure and/or fish barrier, Engineering at least four new shallow lake enhancement structure projects for DNR on designated shallow lakes or basins within state Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) and for the Service on federal Waterfowl Production Areas (WPA), and Providing technical assistance to agency field staff on other shallow lake projects throughout HCP project areas. Through this grant project, DU biologists and engineers surveyed and designed six new water control structures for the Minnesota DNR and US Fish & Wildlife Service, including Sandborn Lake in LeSueur County, Lindsey Lake in Becker County, Everglade Wildlife Management Area in Stevens County, Harder Lake and Wolf Lake Waterfowl Production Areas (WPA) in Cottonwood County, and Henjum WPA in Kandiyohi County. These six bio-engineering projects will be implemented in the future as permits and easements are secured. In addition, DU enhanced 453 wetland acres by constructing previously designed water control structures on the outlets of three shallow lakes, including Block WPA in Grant County, Perch Lake in Blue Earth County on Perch Lake WPA, and Gislason Lake in Lincoln County on the Northern Tallgrass Prairie National Wildlife Refuge. This far surpasses our target goal of enhancing at least one shallow lake totaling 100 wetland acres or more. Finally, DU shallow lakes field biologist provided ongoing technical assistance to Minnesota DNR and the Service on 30 shallow lake projects in HCP Project Areas to help assess and develop new projects for future possible bio-engineering, implementation, and management by those conservation agencies. DU's total cost to provide these bio-engineering services to enhance shallow lakes was $526,225, and included reimbursement of $225,000 from the Environment & Natural Resources Trust Fund through this grant, and the expenditure of $1,249 in Other State Funds and $299,977 in Other Funds (DU and federal funds) that far exceeds the $100,000 in Other Funds that we originally proposed to spend. Project Results Use and Dissemination This grant helped DU, DNR, and the Service accelerate the assessment and enhancement of shallow lakes throughout southern, central and western Minnesota. DU provided six detailed engineering design plans to state and federal agency staff, and informed the public of shallow lake improvement projects through public meetings, news releases sent to the media, and in articles in DU publications.

Infrastructure management may include but is not limited to boundary surveys, boundary signing, professional services, public access, parking lots and user facilities, and clean up of old buildings or wells. Habitat restoration may include but is not limited to grassland development or improvement, wetland restoration or impoundment development, forest or woody cover development or improvement, brush land management, professional services, and food plot development. Digital boundary, habitat inventory and facilities files will be developed as part of the management plans. DNR cannot start work until the Partners have completed acquisition on each parcel. Once the new acquisitions are transferred to the DNR site development and habitat restoration work can occur.

In Habitat Corridor Area 11 in southeastern Minnesota, we contracted to have invasive eastern red cedar and buckthorn removed and controlled on south-facing blufftops on 60.75 acres of private land (5 parcels). These ""goat prairies"" were historically maintained by wind, freeze/thaw cycles, thin soils, and frequent wildfires. Fire suppression has allowed trees, shrubs, and exotic species to encroach upon the prairies. The contractor hand cut, piled, and burned trees and shrubs, and treated invasive species to ensure they would not resprout. This project enhanced prairie and outcrop habitat for state-threatened timber rattlesnakes, as well as three other at-risk snake species and numerous at-risk plant species found in this unique habitat. The resulting open grasslands will also be used as nesting and brood-rearing habitat for wild turkeys and other birds. Participating landowners have signed a 10-year maintenance agreement. Project cost was $67,259.50. In Habitat Corridor 9, we purchased seedlings to plant 150 bur oak, 150 black walnut, and 175 hackberry trees on 11 acres on the Talcot Lake WMA. These trees were protected from herbivory by tree shelters and weed mats. In addition, we purchased 475 seedlings of each of the following fruiting shrubs - chokecherry, red osier dogwood, elderberry, and American plum. All seedlings were planted by DNR staff. This project restored oak savanna and lowland hardwood forest to provide roosting sites for wild turkeys along southwestern Minnesota river corridors, and provided natural winter food resources by planting fruit-bearing shrubs. Project cost was $7,070.23. We had hoped to accomplish more tree planting, but a staff change near the end of the project prevented us from finding a suitable location and order materials before the project deadline.

This project exceeded that goal for a total of nine buffer zones, which were completed on schedule and under budget, totaling 1298 frontage feet of shoreline. This equates to an average cost of $55.82 per foot for planning, installing, and maintaining these shoreline buffer zones which are designed to improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat. In addition to the buffer zones, two field days were provided for the public in 2010 to view buffer zones that had previously been installed. One field day was held near Grand Rapids and one was held in the Alexandria vicinity. The final component of this activity was to collect native origin plant seeds and propagules in 2009 and 2010 for propagation and subsequent planting on buffer zone sites. The goal was to collect seeds for a total of 80 plant species. However, a total of 92 species of native plant seeds and propagules were collected and subsequently used in the plantings. This has been a very successful effort and an excellent partnership between the DNR's Division of Ecological and Water Resources and the Division of Fish and Wildlife to carry out this effort to promote stewardship of lakeshore habitat on private shorelands. Project Results Use and Dissemination Completion of Phase 6 brings to 73 the total number of lakescaping buffer zone demonstration areas that have been installed in 7 habitat corridors in 22 Minnesota counties since May of 2000 with LCMR and LCCMR support provided from the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund. This initiative has been instrumental in promoting this concept of lakeshore stewardship not only throughout Minnesota but also in adjacent states and as far off as Washington state and South Carolina. The book Lakescaping for Wildlife and Water Quality and the new on-line version of Restore Your Shore provide a continuing source of information for people to learn how to plan and install their own buffer zones. Also, the DNR Shoreland Habitat Program continues to offer on-the-ground assistance to local lakeshore associations, landowners, and local and county units of government to initiate lakeshore buffer zones throughout the state. The LCCMR deserves considerable credit for providing funding to help promote this essential concept for stewardship of privately owned lakeshore in Minnesota.

This includes 318 acres on Scientific and Natural Areas (SNA) and 218 acres on perpetual Native Prairie Bank (NPB) easements. Due to a lack of qualified prescribed burn vendors, most burns were implemented by agency crews. Invasive species control treatments were completed on a total of 113 acres, including 48 acres on SNAs and 65 acres on NPB lands. Invasive species treated include buckthorn, siberian elm, red cedar, knapweed, leafy spurge, and cow-vetch. Due to the availability of qualified contractors, many woody invasive species projects were contracted. One reconstruction project totaling 30 acres was completed on the Zilmer WMA, which is part of the larger Felton Prairie Complex. Seed for the reconstruction was collected from surrounding lands. In total, 679 acres of prairie habitat was improved during this project. Project Results Use and Dissemination Ecological and Water Resources invests considerable time in publishing and distributing results in a variety of formats for various audiences.

Additional details, beyond the short summary below, are found in the more detailed reporting provided for each project. Northern Tallgrass Prairie: Prairie was restored on 183 acres (88 acres-ENRTF; 95 acres-other funds) of TNC land on this key parcel for building connections within the Bluestem Prairie complex. Project activities included seed collection, site preparation, sowing, and follow work to control invasives in the restoration area. Western MN Invasives Control & Prescribed Fire: TNC accelerated management activities on 1,067 acres (798 acres-ENRTF; 269 acres-other funds) of TNC lands. Activities included planning/implementing prescribed fire on 1,060 acres, buckthorn removal, and a focused effort on controlling leafy spurge. Prairie Coteau Restoration: Prairie was restored on 84 acres (all acres-ENRTF) of TNC land in a key parcel for connecting remaining areas of native prairie in the Lac qui Parle complex. Completed work included preparing and seeding 71 acres, clearing trees, buckthorn removal, and fence removal. Prairie Forest Border Restoration: This project accelerated prescribed fire and invasives management on 2,091 acres (1,932 acres-ENRTF; 159 acres-other funds) of TNC and public grassland, wetland and forest at 7 sites in Central and Southeastern Minnesota. Individual activities included planning/implementing prescribed fire on 1,392 acres, invasive surveys/treatment on 560 acres, brush removal on 135 acres, and buckthorn removal on 19 acres. NE MN Conifer Restoration: 114 acres (all acres-ENRTF) of TNC and public land was managed to encourage the regeneration of conifers in Northeast Minnesota. Project tasks included installing exclosures and budcaps to prevent browsing and using brush saws, grass mats, and grubbing to control competing vegetation. Sand Prairie Restoration: Prairie was restored on 90 acres and existing habitat was enhanced on an additional 35 acres of TNC land buffering the outstanding native prairie on the adjoining Weaver Dunes SNA (102 acres-ENRTF; 23 acres-other funds). Project activities included seed collection, site preparation, three rounds of sowing with a high-diversity 115-species mix, brush clearing, and surveying/treating invasive species. One thing to note when reviewing detailed information on the individual projects: the completed acres shown for each project may be lower than the number of acres listed for the separate restoration activities. The lower total reflects the fact that multiple activities may have been done on the same acres. In this phase, The Nature Conservancy's (TNC) proposed acquiring fee title to 115 acres of habitat with Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF) and other funds. These projects would emphasize protecting and linking existing public and private conservation lands, helping to build larger, more sustainable areas of habitat. Using ENRTF and private funds, TNC purchased two parcels adjoining Weaver Dunes SNA. The Conservancy purchased the Cox tract (30.6 acres) on November 16, 2010 and the Carroll-Fitzgerald tract (21.7 acres) on December 10, 2010. Together, these parcels total 52.3 acres. Both parcels are located in an area identified as critical in both TNC's and the Habitat Conservation Partnership's planning processes. As part of the Conservation by Design process, The Conservancy develops a Conservation Area Plan (CAP) and Rapid Protection Plan (RPP) for each landscape where we are active. These plans define conservation objectives, management strategies, and areas targeted for action. Both parcels were identified as targets in TNC 's 2007 Conservation Area and Rapid Protection Plans for the Weaver Dunes-Zumbro Delta landscape. Purchasing these parcels protects the native prairie found on portions of both properties. These prairies were ranked as having outstanding biodiversity significance by the Minnesota County Biological Survey. The protection and restoration of the remaining areas of converted or degraded prairie on these tracts will provide a valuable buffer to the large areas of outstanding native prairie on the 6,000 acres of adjoining TNC-, state-, and federally-protected lands. The Conservancy will retain ownership and manage both properties as additions to the Weaver Dunes SNA. Funds for the continuing management of these acquisitions were ensured by placing 20% of the fair market value of the properties in a dedicated stewardship endowment. The income from this endowment provides the resources for approximately 50% of the ongoing costs of land management. The remaining 50% of future funding needs will be raised through private fundraising and private and public grants. TNC was unable to reach our original goal for acres protected. The relatively -high cost of land in Southeastern Minnesota where these tracts are located and the continuing state-wide escalation in rural land prices made this difficult to achieve. The Conservancy spent an additional $235,754.57 of its private funds in transaction-related expenses for these fee title acquisition projects. For more details on the purchases, the associated costs, and their conservation significance, see the Transaction Cost Reporting Guidelines memo submitted to LCCMR on January 14, 2011.

Oak savanna is even rarer in Minnesota than tallgrass prairie and there are numerous plant and wildlife species that depend on this habitat. We removed invasive trees from these areas, restored an open, park-like structure to the vegetation, and created enough light gaps in the tree canopy to support a herbaceous understory. The biomass we removed was stacked and is drying. This fall the biomass will be chipped, hauled to the biomass burning plant in Benson, and converted to electrical power. This was a significant savings. Money that would have been spent burning or removing the biomass from the site was used for additional habitat work. After all the equipment is done at the site, FWS staff will overseed the areas where the trees were removed and any place equipment damaged the soil with a diverse mix of local ecotype grass and forb seed. The long-term maintenance of the site will be done through the FWS's fire management program.1 Originally we planned to do both wetland and oak savanna restoration at the site. However, with the persistent rains over the period of this grant, we were not able to get heavy equipment into the wetlands to restore them. Therefore, we requested and were granted an amendment to spend the wetland funds on additional oak savanna work at the site.

We initiated or continued contact with more than 50 landowners and completed five conservation easements. Collectively, these easements preserve 566 acres of land (508 acres-ENRTF; 58 acres-other funds)- exceeding our original goal of 300 to 500 acres - and protect nearly 17,000 feet of fragile shoreline. Two of the five easements completed involved significant bargain purchases, while the other three projects were donated easements: Rabbit Lake in Aitkin County: 171 acres (all acres-ENRTF) containing forest, wetland, grassland, and hay field being restored to prairie. Blackhoof River in Carlton County: 248 acres (all acres-ENRTF) containing a mix of forest, wetlands, grasslands, and woodlands. Encampment River in Lake County: 88 acres (40 acres-ENRTF; 48 acres-other funds) containing a mature conifer forest with black ash lowlands and wetlands along the Encampment River. Blacklock Nature Sanctuary along Lake Superior in Lake County: 11 acres (1 acre-ENRTF; 10 acres-other funds) containing forest and cobblestone beach along Lake Superior. Lake Elysian in Waseca County: 48 acres (all acres-ENRTF) containing oak savanna and big woods.   All five projects met the following selection criteria: Habitat: quality and quantity of existing habitat on site; protects riparian areas and buffers water resources Context: proximity and relationship to other protected lands Opportunity cost-benefit ratio: which landowners will participate now Other Benefits: meeting multiple objectives, including visual and physical access, forestry goals, water quality, etc. Additionally, the Land Trust prepared baseline property reports for each easement, detailing the condition of the property for future monitoring and enforcement. To fund this required perpetual obligation, the Land Trust dedicated funds to its segregated Stewardship and Enforcement Fund for several completed projects. For these projects, we estimated the anticipated annual expenses of each project and the investment needed to generate annual income sufficient to cover these expenses in perpetuity - all in accordance with our internal policies and procedures as approved by LCCMR. We will report to LCCMR annually on the status of the Stewardship and Enforcement Fund and the easements acquired with funds from this grant. The value is known for only one of the easements. The donated value of this easement is $515,000. The cost to the State of Minnesota to complete the five projects completed under this phase of the grant was just over $370 per acre. Cumulatively, across all phases of the HCP program, the Land Trust has protected 7,461 acres of critical habitat and more than 218,000 feet of shoreline, at a cost to the State of $283 per acre. The Land Trust's work on this project continues to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of working with conservation easements to protect natural and scenic resources along Minnesota's lakes, rivers, and streams, as the cost to the State was well below the cost to purchase land along our increasingly threatened shorelines. This grant continued to generate interest among landowners, and therefore, ongoing funding will be important to sustained success. Additionally, our experiences during this phase of the grant indicate that funds to purchase easements will be necessary in the future as work becomes more targeted, selective, and focused on building complexes of protected land. Project Results Use and Dissemination The Land Trust disseminated information about the specific land protection projects completed under this grant though our newsletter, email updates, web site, and press releases. The Land Trust also shared information about conservation easements generally and our experience with our partner organizations, other easement holders, local communities, as well as policy makers including members of the LCCMR and L-SOHC.

Promotion of individual partnership accomplishments and overall accomplishments was encouraged and several positive articles and events occurred and were shared as a result. ENRTF expenditures for personnel (Project Coordinator and accounting staff) and project coordinator travel totaled $2,242. A total of $25,758 within the personnel budget item was not needed to achieve our results and remains unspent. In addition, $36,025 of ENRTF funds were expended to manage data, operate the online reporting system from which all partner reports are generated, and map all partner projects. Pheasants Forever, Inc. contracted the mapping and data management services for the Phase VI Habitat Conservation Partnership with Community GIS Services of Duluth, Minnesota. Community GIS has made several improvements to the operability of the reporting and mapping system. These updates include identifying free-text fields from the reporting website, and creating pre-populated drop down lists for them. As part of this exercise, all mapping fields were inspected to ensure minimal data duplication within the geodatabase. Metadata was created for the geodatabase at this time as well, which helps to define the fields being used. All HCP project accomplishments and expenditures are accounted for and fully described within the online reporting system and report generation. Anyone can access the Phase VI data electronically from the HCP website. Project Results Use and Dissemination The partnership acknowledges funding from the Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund. Accomplishment report information, mapping products, and project information can be found at www.mnhabitatcorridors.org.

A total of up to 3.5 miles or 35 acres of water bodies in Kandiyohi, Otter Tail, Rice, or Stevens Counties are expected to benefit from restoration activities including installation of aeration systems, development of spawning areas, installation of native vegetation, and stabilization of stream banks.OVERALL PROJECT OUTCOME AND RESULTS Efforts completed under this project consisted of improving water quality and fish/wildlife habitat by installing aeration systems in two waterbodies (Loon and Swansen Lakes in Waseca and Kandiyohi cos), creating and restoring a wetland (Horseshoe Lake in LeSueur Co.), stream improvement to reduce erosion (Hawk Creek in Kandiyohi Co.), and putting in a carp barrier (Diamond/Hubbard Lake in Kandiyohi Co). A total of 2,521 acres or 21 miles of shoreline were modified during this phase to create better fishing. Citizens of the state of Minnesota benefit from these projects by having a better fish community structure that is sustainable by natural reproduction. This then creates better fishing and recreation available in high priority waterbodies in the SW portion of the state. All of the projects were completed by June 30, 2014. PROJECT RESULTS USE AND DISSEMINATION As projects were completed the Department had press releases that were sent out to the local media.

As a result of this appropriation, an estimated $4 million of additional funding for conservation is anticipated to be provided in match by the federal Wetland Reserve Program.OVERALL PROJECT OUTCOME AND RESULTS Most of Minnesota's prairie wetlands and nearly all of our native prairie grasslands have been converted to agriculture or other uses. Restoring and protecting restored native prairie and prairie wetland complexes is a priority for the state as outlined in Minnesota's Prairie Conservation Plan. The federal Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) administered by the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is an important voluntary conservation easement program available to landowners to restore and protect prairie wetland complexes on private land. The objective of the WRP is to restore and protect wetlands and adjacent upland habitats to benefit migratory birds and other wildlife, and improve water quality. To accelerate the WRP in Minnesota, Ducks Unlimited (DU) partnered with the USDA's NRCS to provide technical assistance through eight grant-funded wetland restoration specialist consultants contracted to help NRCS promote and secure new WRP applications and plan and implement restorations on WRP easements secured in previous years. In addition, DU provided engineering services to assist NRCS with survey and preliminary design of two larger wetland restorations requiring complex water control structures to restore wetland hydrology. Through this grant, DU consultant specialists promoted WRP to 955 private landowners, secured/completed/submitted 83 WRP applications, developed or modified 174 WRP conservation plans to guide restoration of WRP easements, designed 15 water control structures for wetland restorations, and helped restore 192 wetlands on WRP easements. In addition, Ducks Unlimited wetland engineers also completed a preliminary engineering report for the large 4,000-acre Crooked Lake restoration project in Douglas County to help inform and guide future landowner outreach efforts, and completed engineering design plans for restoration of the 100-acre Rasmus Lake wetland project in Kandiyohi County. This technical assistance helped NRCS close 36 new WRP easements at a federal cost of $3,985,375 that protects 3,130 acres in Minnesota during this grant period. PROJECT RESULTS USE AND DISSEMINATION Ducks Unlimited consultants promoted the WRP through SWCD newsletters, articles in local newspapers, and in an article written by DU volunteers in the spring 2013 DU state newsletter Cattails.

As a result of this appropriation, an estimated $4 million of additional funding for conservation is anticipated to be provided in match by the federal Wetland Reserve Program.OVERALL PROJECT OUTCOME AND RESULTS Most of Minnesota's prairie wetlands and nearly all of our native prairie grasslands have been converted to agriculture or other uses. Restoring and protecting restored native prairie and prairie wetland complexes is a priority for the state as outlined in Minnesota's Prairie Conservation Plan. The federal Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) administered by the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) is an important voluntary conservation easement program available to landowners to restore and protect prairie wetland complexes on private land. The objective of the WRP is to restore and protect wetlands and adjacent upland habitats to benefit migratory birds and other wildlife, and improve water quality. To accelerate the WRP in Minnesota, Ducks Unlimited (DU) partnered with the USDA's NRCS to provide technical assistance through eight grant-funded wetland restoration specialist consultants contracted to help NRCS promote and secure new WRP applications and plan and implement restorations on WRP easements secured in previous years. In addition, DU provided engineering services to assist NRCS with survey and preliminary design of two larger wetland restorations requiring complex water control structures to restore wetland hydrology. Through this grant, DU consultant specialists promoted WRP to 955 private landowners, secured/completed/submitted 83 WRP applications, developed or modified 174 WRP conservation plans to guide restoration of WRP easements, designed 15 water control structures for wetland restorations, and helped restore 192 wetlands on WRP easements. In addition, Ducks Unlimited wetland engineers also completed a preliminary engineering report for the large 4,000-acre Crooked Lake restoration project in Douglas County to help inform and guide future landowner outreach efforts, and completed engineering design plans for restoration of the 100-acre Rasmus Lake wetland project in Kandiyohi County. This technical assistance helped NRCS close 36 new WRP easements at a federal cost of $3,985,375 that protects 3,130 acres in Minnesota during this grant period. PROJECT RESULTS USE AND DISSEMINATION Ducks Unlimited consultants promoted the WRP through SWCD newsletters, articles in local newspapers, and in an article written by DU volunteers in the spring 2013 DU state newsletter Cattails. Two DU consultants also gave a PowerPoint slide presentation on the WRP partnership with NRCS at the February 2012 DU state convention.",,"Final Report",2011-07-01,2014-06-30,"Environment & Natural Resources Trust Fund",Completed,,,Jon,Schneider,"Ducks Unlimited Inc","311 E Geneva Rd NE",Alexandria,MN,56308,"(320) 762-9916",jschneider@ducks.org,"Land Acquisition, Planning, Restoration/Enhancement, Technical Assistance","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,Statewide,,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/hcp-vii-wetlands-reserve-program-3d,,,,

This project will retrofit the lower 6.5 miles of the ditch and will consist of installing 50 side-inlet structures where current field ditches and old culverts exist; 6.5 miles of water and sediment control structures and 25 acres of buffer strips. When completed, these components will become a permanent part of the ditch system. In addition upland conservation practices will be installed in the watershed to further reduce erosion and sedimentation. These include 1000 acres of cover crop, 5 miles of windbreaks, 200 acres of bufferstrips and 700 acres of reduced tillage. Together all practices will reduce sediment loading by 335 tons/year and peak flows by 50 to 75 percent.

Since the late 1970’s, the Knife River steelhead population has seen a dramatic decline. One major reason for this decline is habitat loss. Habitat loss is a long-term result from historic logging. The pre-settlement forest composition within the Knife River watershed consisted of old growth coniferous trees. Extensive logging removed these trees throughout the watershed, which were replaced by large stands of second growth aspen. This large-scale forest alteration removed the large trees that stabilized the stream banks and attracted unprecedented beaver populations to the watershed due to the new aspen food source. This combination has led to a rapidly deteriorating riparian zone that now includes slumping stream banks, dead trees and remnant beaver meadows. The slumping clay banks have also resulted in a TMDL excedance for turbidity on the Knife River. Recognizing the threat to the upper river, the DNR started performing limited stream studies. These studies have determined that habitat degradation in the watershed has resulted in poor rearing conditions for juvenile trout.The goal of Phase III is to rehabilitate stream banks, wetlands, fish habitat and riparian zone trees that have been impacted over the past 100 years. The LSSA used a combination of aerial data (LIDAR) and river surveys to locate and assess impacted stream areas within the Knife River watershed. A field reconnaissance and detailed stream survey using MPCA and Natural Channel Assessment methodology determined the stream’s condition. Reach 4 (Upper Main Knife River) was ranked very high for a rehabilitation project. Rehabilitation of Reach 4 will be conducted by using design/build construction following Natural Channel Design criteria to achieve a stable stream reach. Phase III will rehabilitate approximately the top 30% of the entire Reach 4 complex. Our scope of work may include:* Survey the stream using MPCA and NCD methodology.* Conduct baseline and periodic stream and biological data collection and monitoring on impact areas.* Track fish movement within the watershed.* Monitor water temperature/quality.* Conduct fish shocking.* Identify erosion areas.* Measure streamflow.* Complete permit applications* Meet with regulators to receive project approvals.* Conduct stakeholder meetings.* Remove log jams/beaver blockages to restore connectivity.* Restore stream flow.* Create and restore wetlands and off-channel ponds.* Perform design/build projects to stabilize streambanks, restore channels and install woody debris using natural channel methodology.* Remove impounded silt and sediments from the streambed.* Planting trees and shrubs to restore the overhead canopy.* Increase spawning/rearing habitat.* Add large woody debris, rock vanes and “J” hooks into the stream.* Post construction survey.By LSOHC recommendation, Zeitgeist and LSSA are partnering in Phase III of this project to meet all of the shared environmental and administrative objectives.

Landwehr and Director Boggess.  Once LSOHC approved the change, the project came together in just a few weeks.  Permits were obtained, four large rocks were donated at no charge by Cliffs Natural Resources-North Shore Mining and the project begun under the direction of the MNDNR.The best two boulders were chosen and mobilized to the site.  In less than three days the boulders were placed and pinned to the bedrock.  The placed boulders created the needed jumping pool immediately below the falls.  Monitoring has confirmed that fish can now easily pass the former barrier in most flows to gain access to the fertile spawning grounds upstream throughout the entire watershed.We had excellent cooperation from St. Louis County Forestry and the MN DNR.TREE PLANTING:The Lake Superior Steelhead Association (LSSA) has long believed that a healthy watershed includes a healthy and diverse riparian zone.  During the initial walk through under Phase I, a superb planting site was noted in the Main West Branch, with excellent access via the North Shore State Trail.A plan was immediately established for a LSSA ‘volunteer’ plant in the spring of 2013.  The BMP for riparian plantings presently is that of a mix of coniferous and deciduous species to provide a more diverse forest.  The LSSA also wanted to expand the plantings to include species that may become common due to future climate change.  The species to be included in our riparian zone plantings in Phase I included tamarack, white spruce, silver maple, river birch and swamp white oak.  The listed species are all native to Minnesota and were approved by the MN DNR.Following the successful 2013 plant, LSSA members came back in 2014 to plant 150 deciduous trees at the same site.  Also in the spring of 2014, Conservation Corp Minnesota planted hundreds more deciduous trees  in another beaver meadow just downstream from the volunteer site.One major lesson learned was that larger sized trees are needed in order to compete with the invasive reed canary grass found throughout the watershed in old beaver meadows.We had excellent cooperation with both the MN DNR and the St. Louis County Forestry Dept. for our planting work.STREAM ASSESSMENTBefore any rehabilitation project could begin in the watershed, the LSSA realized that information must be gathered that would allow us to prioritize any future rehabilitation efforts.Water temperature was a key so 23 temperature loggers were deployed throughout the watershed.  Loggers were in place from June 1 through September 30 so that the data would coincide with data collected by the MNDNR.  This data determined where juvenile trout could survive and grow, which provided a habitat restoration focal point.The Main West Branch and major unnamed tributaries were assessed for stream conditions, possible connectivity blockages, the state of the riparian cover, condition of stream banks, the location of adult spawning habitat and availability of juvenile holding habitat.  The identified impacts were compiled and overlaid with water temperature data so rehabilitation priorities could be selected based on stream biology.  One fact quickly learned was the significant impact of past and present beaver activity in the watershed.  One unnamed tributary had 29 current or historic dams in just over six miles of stream.  The beaver meadows created by these dams allow for invasive reed canary grass to infiltrate throughout the riparian zone eliminating any regeneration of trees.Through the assessment, the LSSA learned that more spring inflow occurred than originally thought by the MNDNR.  We are now able to predict where trout can live, thrive or parish based on water temperature.BLACK ASHIn the Scope of Work for Phase I of our Knife River Habitat Restoration Grant, identification and possible under plantings in black ash stands were discussed.  The emerald ash borer (EAB) has the potential to wipe out huge tracts of black ash stands through out the United Sates.  According to Laurentian RC& D GIS data, the Main West Branch has over 10 miles of black ash cover in the immediate riparian zone.During the assessment portion of Phase I, field notes and GPS coordinates were taken on black ash stands throughout the Main West Branch.  Technological advances have improved making identification of specific tree species possible by satellite imagery.  LIDAR and color infrared imagery (CIR), when combined, give the height, mass and specific electromagnetic spectrum to plants.  Black ash is rather unique in that it is usually the last to leaf out in the spring and one the earliest to lose its leaves in the fall.  Using our field data and comparing the CIR imagery for the area after black ash had lost their leaves and other deciduous trees maintained their leave cover, we could identify areas that held black ash.Our work was very timely in that the EAB has now been identified in Duluth’s Park Point neighborhood, most recently, in far eastern Duluth.One major item learned from both CIR/LIDAR imagery and verified in the field is that black ash stands are of mixed deciduous species-ash, maple and some yellow birch making under planting less imperative.",2012-07-01,2016-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Kevin,Bovee,"Lake Superior Steelhead Association","PO Box

Site Selection: The Lake Superior Steelhead Association (LSSA) conducted a rapid stream survey to determine the Knife River’s overall condition.  As stream impacts were identified during the survey, impaired stream reaches were photographed and mapped using a GPS unit.  The LSSA also monitored water temperatures to determine where trout survival is the highest.  Finally, biological data was collected to determine the quality of in-stream trout habitat.  This data was combined to rank and prioritize restoration areas where the worst stream impacts are restored, that reside in coolest water zones, within the best habitat corridors.  This data concluded that “first-priority reaches” were located in the upper main Knife River.  This also achieves our goal of a top-down restoration approach  Riparian planting sites were determined by site accessibility and stream assessment using procedures listed above.  Specified project riparian species were determined by the existing riparian habitat, upland or wetland conditions and exposure to sunlight. Restoration Techniques: Natural Channel Design (NCD) utilizes a science-based process to bring an unstable eroding stream reach back to a stable state.  This method surveys an impacted stream reach to collect data to compare it to several stable stream sections.  All survey work is performed using a geomorphic trained Stream Specialist.  The assessment data that is collected includes: stream width to depth ratios, floodplain elevation, erosion calculations, longitudinal profile, cross-section elevation and vegetation cover.  This assessment data is entered into a computer program called Geomorph to create plans and specifications that will redesign the impacted Knife River channel profile, dimensions and shape to mimic stable reaches within the Knife River Watershed. These plans create the basis for the construction project by depicting channel reconfiguration, placement of structures, location of streambed excavation, location and elevation of the floodplain and realignment of the channel.       The LSSA’s NCD process also features a top/down restoration approach.  This approach extends the habitat corridor downstream in three ways: •    Downstream habitats are protected because the upstream sediment load is reduced.   By stabilizing these upstream eroding banks, hundreds of tons of sediment will no longer discharge into the stream channel each year.  This discharged material will no longer fill pools and runs that are critical to rearing trout. •    Instream trout spawning success is more productive.  When trout spawn they discharge their eggs into the gravel.  When sediment discharges during high spring flood events, these eggs or newly hatched trout become covered by settling silts and suffocate larval trout.  By stabilizing these upstream banks sediment discharge is greatly reduced, which generally aids trout production. •    Newly constructed stream channels are reconnected to the floodplain.  These restoration projects reconnect the stream channel to the floodplains, which allows floodwaters to crest the bank and dissipate the current’s energy.  Floodwaters also become trapped and stored in associated floodplain wetlands.  This results in a lower velocity of floodwater and less volume of floodwater that discharges downstream.  This reduction of floodwater velocity and volume minimizes downstream erosion and habitat degradation.  Riparian Zone Planting Projects: •    The species of trees/shrubs being incorporated into the planting plan depends on the area to be planted.  Rehabilitating an abandoned beaver meadow will require species that can tolerate rather damp conditions and even periods of flooding.  The planting of higher elevations, which are not as wet and experience less flooding events, will utilize a wider array of species. •    Wet area species include: white spruce, tamarack, swamp white oak, river birch, silver maple and speckled alder. •    Higher elevation/dryer area species include: red pine, white pine, red maple, silver maple, bur oak, red oak, northern mountain ash and speckled alder. •    Shrubs/Pollinator Species That Are Utilized: viburnum, red twig dogwood, black chokeberry, snowberry, downy arrow-wood, sand bar willow. •    Several species listed above can be utilized in multiple planting locations. •    The LSSA uses locally procured stock for all of our plantings. Scope of Work: •    In stream Habitat Work Area: For PH II of the Knife River Habitat Rehabilitation Project, we restored approximately 2200 linear feet of stream on the main Knife River using the NCD processes.  Included in the area was the rehabilitation of largest slumping clay bank above Lake County Hwy 11.  This bank alone deposited tons of sediment downstream annually. •    Riparian Zone Work Area: We performed planting projects on the main stem of the Knife River and tributaries-the Main West Branch and Stanley Creek.  We planted both low areas and higher ground areas using the species mentioned above. Project Successes: •    In stream Habitat Work: Immediately following construction (and even during the project construction) trout were seen utilizing this stretch of river, ranging from young of the year to spawning adult ages.  Sediment being transported and deposited downstream or even out in Lake Superior has been lessened with the project. •    Riparian Zone Work: We planted many hundreds of trees in PH II creating a diverse riparian zone for years to come. Unique Aspects of the Project: •    Instream Habitat Work: One unique feature of our project is that we contracted with area loggers to bring in toe wood for areas where designated on the design plans.  Some groups prefer to take as much of the needed supplies from the work zone (toe wood, rocks, etc) but this increases the impact on the environment.  The LSSA tries to be as minimally intrusive on the stream and the riparian zone as possible in the project area.  All material that has to be removed for the project is 100% reincorporated back to the project area. •    Riparian Zone Work: The LSSA tried carrying in tree plugs to very remote areas in five gallon buckets.  We found that you could carry almost 50 plugs in one bucket to far removed planting sites much easier than individually potted trees.  This process worked best on areas that had recent beaver activity but the beaver had moved on and the dams had been breached.

The LSSA proposes to rehabilitate instream habitat to increase trout spawning and rearing. Natural Channel Design construction techniques will be utilized to create a self-sustaining project that enhances instream habitat, improves channel stability, facilitates sediment transportation, stabilizes eroding streambanks, creates riparian wetlands and replant riparian trees/pollinator shrubs. This project will only be performed on public land or private land within a DNR easement. For more project information, please visit our website: www.steelheaders.org/projects.","Problem Addressed: The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) performed a water quality study from 1986-1996 on the Knife River. This water quality study determined that the Knife River exceeded the TMDL for turbidity. The MPCA conducted a follow-up study in 2008 to determine the sources of this turbidity. This study determined that the sources of the TMDL turbidity exceedance was primarily due to erosion from streambanks and stream bluffs. The LSSA assessed these identified erosion areas in the watershed (see illustration) to determine if the habitat remained suitable for trout. The LSSA found that summertime streamflow and water temperatures were sufficient for trout growth, but instream habitat was degraded from sediment deposition. The LSSA and DNR have concluded that adult trout spawning and juvenile trout rearing habitat could be significantly improved by rehabilitating this stream reach. This project will provide an added secondary benefit to water quality by reducing sediment discharge. By stabilizing these banks this project will be contributing to reducing the Knife River's elevated Turbidity levels. Scope of Work: ?Restore the stream channel's shape, dimension and profile. ?Enhance instream trout habitat strategically positioning large woody debris, rock vanes and ?J? hooks into the channel. ?Restore large woody debris back into the watershed. ?Create new floodplains wetlands. ?Remove flood debris/sediment from floodplain wetlands. ?Reconnect the river channel to the floodplain. ?Raise the groundwater table. ?Stabilize streambanks. ?Rehabilitate the riparian overhead tree canopy. ?Monitor water temperature and stream assessment. How Priorities Were Set: The MPCA identified erosion areas within the Knife River Watershed and determined sections of Reach 4 contributed to the overall TMDL exceedance for Turbidity. The LSSA also conducted a series of stream assessments to identify adequate streamflow and cool water temperatures to support trout growth. Biological data was collected to determine the quality of in-stream trout habitat. This data was combined and ranked to prioritize restoration areas that provide the best benefit to aquatic life and water quality in the Knife River Watershed. Another major consideration in the prioritization of this stream reach is its upstream location. Our restoration goal is to utilize a top-down approach, so major upstream erosion does not re-impact the restoration project and floodwaters can be retained to minimize existing downstream impacts. So, this top/down approach not only rehabilitates a degraded upstream reach but also minimizes downstream impacts. Urgency and Opportunity of the Project: The upper section of Reach 4 is scheduled for construction during the summer of 2019 and the middle section of Reach 4 was awarded last year (2108) and construction is anticipated to begin the fall of 2019. This Lower Reach 4 project will restore the remaining 4,000+ linear feet of Reach 4. If this project is funded, construction will begin in the fall of 2020. Stakeholder Involvement: The LSSA has collaborated with Jeff Tillma, DNR Stream Specialist and Deserae Hendrickson, DNR Fisheries Supervisor for the past three years on the Reach 4 restoration project and have implemented several of the DNR's project recommendations.",,2020-07-01,,"Outdoor Heritage Fund","In Progress",,,Tony,Cuneo,"Zeitgeist (ZG) and Lake Superior Steelhead Association (LSSA)","222 E.

",,62000,"City of Bemidji ",1602600,,,,"City of Bemidji","Local/Regional Government","After a century of industrial use, the project brought Lake Bemidji's South Shore to its original state. The city removed 1,144 tons of contaminated soil and sediment, 9,400 cubic yards of woody debris from the lake-bottom and planted native vegetation on the shoreline to restore and enhance aquatic habitat. ","   ","The Lake Bemidji South Shore Restoration and Enhancement project transformed a blighted shoreline and disturbed lake bed of one of northern Minnesota’s finest urban lakes into a model of restoration to its native state, improving water quality and aquatic habitat. The project was the final step of a restoration effort led by the City of Bemidji, in partnership with the Minnesota DNR and DEED. Lake Bemidji is the first major lake in the Upper Mississippi River watershed. It supports a diverse high quality fishery for walleye, northern pike, yellow perch and muskie. These species are dependent on high quality habitats.  The south shore of Lake Bemidji has a long history of industrial use which altered the shoreline and impacted water quality. The site housed several industries, primarily forestry companies. With their closing and/or relocation, the site became a blighted brownfield. Adjacent to downtown Bemidji, the project includes approximately 4/10 mile of shoreline. From 2008-2014, the City of Bemidji partnered with DNR and DEED to clean-up the site and restore the shoreline to its native state. Specifically: -    The City purchased the site and placed it in the MPCA Voluntary Investigation and Clean-Up (VIC) Program, and using a DEED redevelopment grant, cleaned up roughly 50 acres of land. -    The DNR purchased land from the City and extended the Paul Bunyan State Trail through the site. -    The City permanently designated the lakeshore between the trail and the lake as public land. -    The DNR purchased a large parcel of the eastern shoreline as a DNR Aquatic Management Area. Much work remained on the lakeshore and in lake bed. Approximately 9,400 cubic yards of woody debris from the old Crookston Lumber remained in the lake bottom and along the south shore. The debris covered 1,500 feet of lakeshore extending 200 feet from the shore and ranging from 1 to 4 feet deep.  The lakeshore needed to be restored to its original state, including native vegetation, trees, shrubs and natural erosion control. The land between the trail and the lake (3.1 acres) was replanted with native vegetation, improving water quality and habitat in the lake and 0.6 acre was restored for use by the public as a swimming beach, rest stop along the bike trail, and education area, totaling 3.7 acres restored for ecological and public use. The project returned the south shore of Lake Bemidji to its native state for the first time in a century, improved the shoreline and addressed water quality and aquatic habitat issues in an urban-recreational setting.  Now that restoration and enhancement is complete, the City developed (with funding outside Outdoor Heritage Council support) a regional park that provides public education on water quality and aquatic habitat restoration. The park utilizes roughly 20 percent of the shoreline. The project balances environmental protection and enhancement and public use and education on one of northern Minnesota’s premier lakes. The following was completed with Outdoor Heritage Fund support: Shoreline Restoration:  The historic industrial use of the site altered the south shoreline of Lake Bemidji. The effect was reduced water quality and compromised aquatic habitat. In May 2014, DNR specialists assessed the south shore site and determined the potential of restoring the site. The DNR recommended substantial clean-up and restoration work to improve water quality, habitat and erosion control. The restoration plan included: -    Site monitoring -    Site preparation/treatment of weeds -    Installation of native seed mixes -    Installation of 10,000 native plugs -    Planting 800 (#2) shrubs -    Planting 10 (#10) native trees -    Weed control  -    Installation of erosion control The city is committed to maintaining the improvements long term through its parks and recreation department.  Woody Debris Removal: The City studied the woody debris issue and completed design plans that lowered the lake level with a temporary cofferdam (protecting the fish) and excavating the debris out of the lake.  The City received the following permits: -    DNR Water Permit -    Army Corps of Engineers Permit -    MPCA Solid Waste/Beneficial Reuse -    Section 106 Review -    Bois Forte Band and Leech Lake Band Clearance Letter The construction work was publicly bid and specified the use of a water barrier cofferdam, Aquabarrier, Portadam, or equal. The Engineer reviewed these brands and permits were based on the specifications. MPCA VIC Program costs for remediation of contaminated soil/sediment is a fee program so costs were incurred for review. Approximately 9,400 cubic yards of woody debris was removed and replaced with sand. The excavated area extended 200 feet out from the shore, covering 1,440 feet of shoreline and depth of 1 to 4 feet. Overall, 240,000 square feet of Lake Bemidji was cleaned up and restored.  The woody debris was sampled and primarily used as clean backfill on site or properly disposed of if contaminated. Approximately 400 tons of contaminated soil and 750 tons of contaminated sediment/wood debris was managed and disposed of at a permitted landfill. The City spent $63,800 in design and permitting. The estimated cost to restore the lake bed was $1.5 million with vegetation restoration totaling $150,000. The City used Landmark Environmental, LLC and Anderson Engineering of MN for construction management because they designed, assisted in bidding, and acquired permits. The City believed they provided high quality and reasonably priced services. Landmark has staff in Bemidji and engineers and staff traveled from Twin Cities to Bemidji for meetings and construction as needed. Summary: Lake Bemidji is one of northern Minnesota’s most critical natural assets. The City of Bemidji requested and received $1.65 million in Outdoor Heritage funding to complete the shoreline restoration and woody debris removal. The restoration and enhancement improves water quality and habitat to native conditions.  The South Shore Lake Bemidji project was a finalist for a Minnesota Brownfields ReScape Award in 2017 for small city impact.  ",2015-07-01,2020-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Nate,Mathews,"City of Bemidji","317 Fourth Street NW ",Bemidji,MN,56601,"(218) 759-3565",nate.mathews@ci.bemidji.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,Beltrami,"Northern Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/lake-bemidji-south-shore-restoration-and-enhancement,,,,

This project will enhance 4580 linear feet of shoreline.","The enhancement activity included in this project will improve habitat for fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and aquatic invertebrates in the entirety of Lake Nokomis. The lake measures 200 acres; approximately half is less than 15 feet deep. The lake is owned entirely by MPRB. Its shoreline consists of a combination of Works Progress Administration stone wall in varying condition along with stretches of turfgrass with poor quality native shoreline buffer and little emergent vegetation along the eroding lake edge. It is an important stop-over for migratory waterfowl, songbirds, and shorebirds that use the Mississippi River Flyway, such as wood ducks, loons, grebes, coots, warblers, vireos, grosbeaks, herons, rails, and sandpipers. Lake Nokomis is limited in its habitat potential due primarily to its lack of clarity and lack of aquatic vegetation. The poor water clarity is attributable to a negative feedback cycle centered on an imbalance in the fish population. Periodic fish surveys have found that small black bullheads and small panfish are overabundant in the lake. There is not enough aquatic vegetation in the lake for these species’ shelter and food needs (plants would serve as habitat to prey insects), so these species root in the substrate in search of food. Sediment re-suspension increases turbidity in the lake and also instigates algae blooms by releasing nutrients back into the water column. Sediment- and algae-based turbidity then further suppresses plant growth by preventing light penetration to the lakebed. Aquatic and shoreline vegetation is critical to overall lake clarity and habitat. A study by Canfield and Hoyer (1992) has shown that lakes with at least 40% vegetative coverage function as high quality habitat lakes with good water clarity. Lake Nokomis currently has 11% vegetative coverage. Plants grow only to lake depths up to 8 feet and not in the entire littoral (15-foot maximum depth) zone—which constitutes about half the lake.This project will enhance of 4580 linear feet of shoreline by regrading banks to stabilize erosion, removing invasive plants in the shoreline buffer, and installing appropriate native emergent and shoreline plants.This activity is proposed based on extensive scientific study of the lake. A variety of other previous efforts that have improved the lake’s habitat. In 2001 MCWD and MPRB installed a weir between Lake Nokomis and Minnehaha Creek to reduce nutrient inflow to the lake from the creek, then modified that weir in 2012 to protect against zebra mussels. Also in in 2001, MPRB, MCWD, and the City of Minneapolis installed several native species-planted storm water treatment ponds near the lake to pre-treat urban runoff and provide habitat for various animal species. Nearby residents and groups such as Friends of Lake Nokomis, Blue Water Commission, the Nokomis East Neighborhood Association, and the Hale Page Diamond Lake Neighborhood Association have historically supported efforts to improve lake water quality and habitat through participation in planning and with volunteer efforts.Lake Nokomis has excellent habitat potential. MPRB and MCWD have been studying this generally shallow lake for years and have implemented some critical habitat improvements already. LSOHC funding would leverage MPRB and MCWD’s efforts through each agency’s general operations and maintenance funding. It would allow the next phase of habitat enhancement to occur.

The shallow lakes and large marshes that remain now serve as the core of Minnesota’s remaining waterfowl habitat complexes, and are often those basins that were too deep to drain. These remaining wetlands now receive excessive water and nutrient runoff from a highly altered and intensively drained landscape, and are easily accessed by invasive fish such as common carp. As a result, many basins are now turbid and degraded due to high, stable water levels that allow carp and other invasive fish to proliferate and aquatic ecology to stagnate. The results is a lack of aquatic plants and invertebrates required to sustain migrating and breeding waterfowl, especially those species that rely on aquatic foods exclusively such as diving ducks.As a result, ducks migrating through Minnesota on their way north to breed in spring find sparse aquatic food resources, much to their detriment further north, and also again in the fall when their passage through Minnesota appears briefer each year. Those waterfowl that remain here to breed find poor brood-rearing habitat, as shallow lakes and marshes have a paucity of high quality wetland habitat with abundant aquatic plants and invertebrate food resources on which young ducks rely. These factors have contributed to a decline in Minnesota’s diverse waterfowl resources and, unfortunately, a decline in Minnesota’s rich waterfowling traditions.To remedy this situation, Ducks Unlimited’s “Living Lakes Initiative” assists the Minnesota DNR, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, and other conservation partners to enhance and restore Minnesota’s shallow lakes and wetlands. This grant supported Phase 2 of Ducks Unlimited's biological and engineering work to design and construct water control structures and fish barriers. DU biologists worked closely with Minnesota DNR Shallow Lakes Program biologists to assess wetland conditions and identify possible management solutions. DU biologists and engineers surveyed, designed, and constructed the water control infrastructure necessary for state and federal agency staff to actively manage water levels. Funding in this request also supported ongoing shallow lake technical assistance from DU biologists and engineers to assess, survey, and design future projects for implementation under future OHF appropriations.Most enhancement work occured in the Prairie Region by design, as that is where waterfowl are in most need of habitat improvements.  Structures are used by agency managers to simulate natural temporary drought cycles in shallow lakes and wetlands that rejuvenate the aquatic ecological process that produces abundant aquatic plants and invertebrates. These structures last for 30 or more years and are generally use by agency staff every 5-7 years to conduct periodic temporary draw-downs that are key to enhancing and maintaining highly productive wetlands. Importantly, DU also restored smaller wetlands on public and other protected land near shallow lakes. Shallow lakes were selected for enhancement by DNR and FWS managers, and generally enjoy strong support from the public for improvement. The Minnesota DNR holds public meetings to share information on the current condition and management plan for shallow lakes designated for wildlife management purposes.PlanningEvery statewide conservation plan recognizes the need for improving and protecting Minnesota’s shallow lakes and associated wetlands for optimal wildlife habitat. The Minnesota DNR’s Duck Recovery Plan is the most specific, calling for the active management of 1,800 shallow lakes and adding 64,000 restored wetlands to Minnesota’s landscape. DU’s Living Lakes Initiative supports this plan through a goal of improving 300 Minnesota shallow lakes in 10 years. Shallow lakes and wetlands are identified as critical habitat for several “Species of Greatest Conservation Need” listed in Minnesota’s “Tomorrow’s Habitat for the Wild & Rare: An Action Plan for Minnesota Wildlife”, including lesser scaup, northern pintail, and trumpeter swan.Importantly, Ducks Unlimited’s Living Lakes Initiative directly address Minnesota’s Statewide Conservation & Preservation Plan Habitat Recommendations #4 and #5 on pages 78 and 80, respectively, which calls for the restoration and protection of shallow lakes (page 78) and the restoration of land, wetlands, and watersheds (page 80). This program addresses the LSOHC priorities of wetland and shallow lake restoration and enhancement in the Prairie and Forest-Prairie Transition sections.

Nongame wildlife such as shorebirds and wading birds suffer too. As a result, ducks migrating through Minnesota on their way north in spring find sparse aquatic food resources, much to their detriment when they stop to breed further north due to the importance of nutrient reserves required for egg laying.  Those waterfowl that remain here to breed encounter poor brood-rearing habitat, as few shallow lakes and marshes here have high quality wetland habitat with abundant aquatic plants and invertebrate food resources on which young ducks rely.  These factors have contributed to a decline in Minnesota’s diverse waterfowl resources and, unfortunately, a decline in Minnesota’s rich waterfowling traditions.

Sedimentation in Upper Mississippi River (UMR) backwaters and declining UMR floodplain forests are a concern to resource managers, anglers, hunters and recreational users. This proposal includes dredging accumulated sediments from a 15 acre backwater in upper Pool 9 and utilizing that material to bury invasive Reed Canary Grass and enhance topographical diversity on 20 acres of Mississippi River floodplain in support of tree planting and floodplain forest restoration.","Aquatic habitat in backwaters of the UMR are filling due to sedimentation from tributary inputs, altered hydrology and island erosion. Backwaters that historically provided deep water habitat and refuge to fish, reptiles and amphibians have decreased in quantity and quality throughout the UMR. The 15 acre aquatic area in upper Pool 9 to be enhanced by dredging will benefit bluegill, crappie and bass populations. Additionally, the area to be dredged is located in a protected bay adjacent to a public access and will increase year-round angling opportunities for multiple fish species. This is a unique project in that dredged material (silts and clays) will be used beneficially to enhance topographic diversity in support of floodplain forest restoration.Much of the existing floodplain forest in the Upper Pool 9 project area has been declining in coverage over the past several decades. Flat topography, higher groundwater levels caused by impoundment, increased frequency and duration of inundation, and reduced creation of new islands and shoreline have decreased the amount of terrestrial land cover suitable for sustaining forested communities in this area and throughout the UMR floodplain. Furthermore, increased competition from Reed Canary Grass (RCG), an aggressively invasive species whose occurrence is widespread throughout the project area, has adversely affected forest regeneration and altered the natural succession of open areas to forest. Placement of dredged material on a 20 acre area consisting of a monotypic stand of RCG will bury the invasive RCG, increase floodplain elevations by 2 - 3 feet and provide a clean medium for tree planting and direct seeding to restore the floodplain forest community, benefiting SGCN neo-tropical migrant bird species such as Prothonotary and Cerulean warblers.This project directly addresses the systemic issues of floodplain forest loss and habitat fragmentation, and is a priority action item in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) UMR Systemic Forest Management Plan. It incorporates a variety of floodplain forest restoration components such as: increasing tree species diversity; reintroduction of a hard mast component in floodplain forest communities; improving wildlife habitat; incorporation of innovative restoration measures such as the utilization of dredge materials for the purpose of increasing topographic diversity; and invasive species control and management. In addition, the project lends itself to the adaptive management process by incorporating a variety of restoration measures as well as post-project monitoring to measure their effectiveness, thereby informing future floodplain forest restoration efforts. As stated in the report ""Ecological Status and Trends of the Upper Mississippi River System 1998"" (USGS 1999), ""The ecosystem as a whole benefits from floodplain forests. Besides serving as a rich habitat for wildlife and fish during floods; the forests reduce soil erosion, improve water quality and provide a scenic and recreational landscape."" Floodplain forest restoration in this location will allow for direct comparison with other floodplain forest restoration techniques being utilized in adjacent parcels by partner organizations and agencies.

Non-OHF funds were applied to complete feasibility and design in order to optimize application of construction funds. The resulting sheltered bay provides critical coastal wetland habitat for many species of fish and wildlife that utilize the St. Louis River estuary. Wild rice was also established in the bay after construction as part of the separate Wild Rice Restoration Project.Prior to restoration activities, wood waste covered almost the entire open-water portion of the bay. Wood waste was also present under areas of emergent vegetation. Depth of wood waste ranged from 0.2 feet to 3.3 feet. The average water depth was approximately one foot. Although the bay was relatively shallow, submergent and emergent vegetation were only present along the perimeter of the bay. Shallow water depths also limited ecological function of the bay as well as its recreational value to anglers and other boaters.Approximately 115,000 cubic yards of wood waste and wood sediment mixes were removed from Radio Tower Bay. The material was pumped to a dewatering site on US Steel property and was beneficially reused to restore their Superfund site after remediation. The Project resulted in increasing the average water depth of the bay from one foot to 3.7 feet and increased the maximum depth from 2.3 feet to 7.4 feet. A 5.5-acre area with an average water depth of 7.5 feet and channel depth of 5.0 feet will act as a connection between the St. Louis River and the bay, which creates off-river, overwintering fish habitat and improves access for boaters. The bed of Radio Tower Bay is now composed of native silt, unconsolidated organic matter, and clay substrates that have been exposed by the removal of wood waste. Wild Rice was seeded in approximately 15 acres of Radio Tower Bay in 2015 and 2016. Previously seeding areas will be reseeded in 2017 if necessary.All objectives were met and all construction activities went as planned. The technique to grind up wood and sediment mixes and hydraulically pump them to a dewatering facility for drying was revolutionary. The resulting clean organic material was deemed highly desirable as a substrate to restore remediated areas on the US Steel Superfund Site. After removal of material, the dewatering facility will continue to function and will be used to dewater wood waste from Mud Lake (ML2018 OHF proposal), which will substantially reduce the cost of the project.Knowlton CreekThe Knowlton Creek Watershed Project restored and enhanced approximately 6,500 linear feet of cold-water stream habitat using Natural Channel Design techniques. Construction outcomes were successful in eliminating erosion and transport of sediment along all reaches restored. Brook trout migration was established or enhanced along 3,000 feet of the stream (the remaining length was too steep). The Project was completed after Spirit Mountain Recreation Area constructed water control structures at the base of their ski hill to transport excess runoff away from Knowlton Creek and directly to the estuary through the pipe used to transport water from the estuary for snow making. This was a revolutionary partnership and methodology. The Project was designed through a MNDNR/USACE partnership with no OHF funding. The restoration methodology applied was a geomorphologic approach appropriate for the hydrology following the Natural Channel Design methodology (Applied River Morphology, Rosgen, 1996).Construction of in-stream structures (boulder jam steps, boulder jam riffles, toe wood, pocket pools and log vanes with boulder hooks) will improve aquatic habitat diversity and stabilize the bed. Native upland grasses and forbes were planted as well as approximately 15,000 trees along the riparian corridor. During construction, MNDNR, Stantech, Veit/Cardno’s field staff worked together to compile construction observation reports and note deviations from the site plans. Overall, the project implementation partners were very effective at addressing project level circumstances. There were a number of design changes that resulted from conditions encountered in the field. Coordination with project partners such as the City of Duluth, Cloquet Pumping Station, Spirit Mountain, MNDOT, private landowners, as well as, resource professionals within the MNDNR, MPCA and USACE was key to the success of the project. In some instances, earlier coordination of the more critical elements of the project would have eliminated some of the additional implementation time needed to complete the restoration.21st Ave W/Interstate IslandThe scope of Interstate Island was to restore colonial waterbird nesting and young rearing habitat through the addition of sand and gravel, vegetation management, and management of the ring-billed population, thereby contributing to implementation of Actions 1.32 and 1.361 in the Recovery Plan for the Great Lakes Piping Plover. Reproductive success of Common Terns nesting on Interstate Island was degraded due to the low elevation of part of the island, vegetation encroachment, and competition for nesting space from ring-billed gulls.The Project was designed by MNDNR with no OHF funding. The contractor placed 730 linear feet of temporary silt fencing, 3,276 cubic yards of clean beach sand, 610 cubic yards of cobble rip-rap, 28 cubic yards of surface amendments (pebbles & gravel), and 620 linear feet of sediment control log. MN & WDNR staff and volunteers removed all fenced gull exclosures and string grids prior to construction. These were replaced in spring of 2016 as part of regular departmental Piping Plover/Common Tern monitoring and management efforts. Common Terns have been successfully using the enhanced habitat since the Project was completed.Wild Rice (Rask Bay)A total of 133 acres of wild rice was restored at several locations in the St. Louis River estuary in 2015 and 2016. Previously seeded location were reseeded in 2017 as needed. Additionally, WDNR and the MN Land Trust restored 83 acres of wild rice beds on the Wisconsin side of the estuary. National Fish & Wildlife Foundation applied $400K and no OHF funding was applied to restoration work on the Wisconsin side of the estuary. A total of 216 acres is in the process of being restored on both sides of the estuary as part of this cooperative project between WDNR and MNDNR.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) restored 112.7 acres of bluff prairie in Houston County; 8 acres of deep water habitat in Goose Lake (navigation pool 5 of the Mississippi River) and enhanced 200 acres of secondary channel and backwater lake habitat in North and Sturgeon Lakes (navigation pool 3 of the Mississippi River). ",,"Root River Tract (RRT):  Project planning and design included site elevation surveys, development of hydrologic models and analysis of restoration alternatives.  Recommended features to restore hydrologic connectivity included: removal of existing water control structures, installation of ditch plugs and breaching of existing low level levees and dikes.   A public informational meeting to seek input on a preliminary project plan was held and feedback from that meeting used to refine project alternatives.   A draft Environmental Assessment (EA) which evaluated four alternatives for restoring/enhancing the RRT was completed and released for a 30-day public comment period in September 2015.  A public meeting to discuss the proposed project and draft EA was held in October 2015.  Responses to comments received were provided in the final EA.  A Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) for the preferred alternative was signed by the Regional Director, Region 3 of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in January 2015.   Restoring natural topography and drainage patterns required removal of existing dikes/levees; construction of ditch plugs using fill materials excavated from existing dikes/levees; removal of existing water control structures; and filling of an existing fish pond with materials excavated from existing dikes/levees.  Plans and specifications for completing this work were developed and local, State and Federal permits were acquired.  Work was accomplished through a combination of contracts and skilled hired labor workers in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Heavy equipment (track trucks, backhoes, skid steers, etc.) was used to accomplish the work.  Large rainfall events in the watershed of the Root River created several floods in 2016 which affected project completion.  In September 2016, flooding on the Root River resulted in a levee breach that brought large amounts of floodwater from the Root  into the project area.  While this flooding delayed completion of some of the project features, it created a unique opportunity to observe how the project would function under flood conditions.  As a result of first-hand, on-site observations of flood waters entering and exiting the project site, project features were modified to enhance the overall hydrologic function of the project. In 2017, installation of low water crossings at locations where trials/roads traveling through the project area crossed restored river channels, oxbows and sloughs, finishing ditch plugs, native seeding, forest enhancement (planting of hard mast trees and flood plain species) and final grading of the project was completed.  Wet conditions and high Mississippi and Root River levels delayed completion of final project features in 2017.   The original goal for wetland and forest enhancement was to restore or enhance 700 acres.  That goal was achieved on time and under budget.  Approximately $299,612 was expended on the Root River project.  The cost of this project component was estimated at $450,000.   Bluff Prairie Restoration:  Bluff prairies, also known as “goat prairies” are a unique and rare habitat in southeastern Minnesota.  Goat prairies are found typically on south or west facing slopes.  Many if not most of these prairies are negatively affected by the invasion of tree species, in particular, red cedar trees.  Removal of red cedar trees as well as other trees from these prairies enhances light penetration to the vegetative layer under the trees and invigorates dormant/shaded prairie plants and seeds.  Restoring a natural fire regime through controlled burning on these sites further enhances prairie development.  Selection of prairies for restoration was based on public ownership and/or willingness of private landowners to have worked completed on their property.  Work was accomplished by contract to businesses familiar with goat prairie restoration techniques.  The original goal for bluff prairie restoration under this grant was to restore 70 acres.  The final bluff prairie acreage restored was 112.7 acres on 8 sites.  This project component was completed, on time, on budget ($150,000 spent) and exceeded the project acreage objective. Pool 3 (North and Sturgeon Lakes) – Pool 5 (Goose Lake):  This project component initially involved multiple habitat restoration/enhancement objectives using established large river restoration techniques such as water level management, channel modifications, island building and dredging. A “cost-share partnership agreement” between the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Minnesota DNR was needed to fully execute the project, however, the federally funded portion of the project was placed in deferment until the language associated with partnership agreement and future project management could be amended to satisfy legal requirements. Based on these challenges, an amendment to the accomplishment plan for Pool 3 was approved on July 10, 2015 which reduced the dollar amount of leverage expected from the Federal Government and the potential scope of the project. An additional amendment was submitted and approved in March 2016 which added Goose Lake (Pool 5) as a project site and defined that portion of the Pool 3 project to only include a channel modification at the Brewer Lake inlet. Approximately $500,000 Federal dollars were leveraged and spent on planning and development of preliminary project specifications and Environmental Assessment (EA) for the larger project. Products from this planning effort were used to develop final plans and specs and to obtain the necessary permits for the LSOH funded channel modification project.  In 2016, 8 acres of Goose Lake was dredged to a depth of 7 feet to restore fisheries habitat. Backwater habitats are declining as a result of sedimentation. Dredging to restore depth in backwaters benefits many aquatic species by providing habitat suited for overwintering.  Permits were secured and a contract for the channel modification project at Brewer Lake inlet was awarded in April 2017. Placement of a rock channel liner and shoreline protection was performed from barge mounted heavy equipment. Construction was completed in the spring of 2018. Pre-project monitoring of habitat conditions, fish populations and freshwater mussel populations was completed before construction.

",,"Enhance 5,100 acres of wetlands ",,8478000,"Federal Funds ",2630000,,,,DNR,"State Government","The primary goal of the Marsh Lake Ecosystem Restoration Project is, “To return the Marsh Lake area ecosystem to a less degraded and more natural condition by restoring ecosystem structure and functions.”  Work was completed on this project in March 2020 and consisted of a new water control structure to allow for water level management, restoration of the Pomme de Terre River to its original channel, and establishment of a fishway to allow for movement of native fish. ",,"Marsh Lake is an impoundment of the Minnesota River in west-central Minnesota near Appleton. Marsh Lake was created in the late 1930s by construction of a dam which resulted in a shallow lake that measured approximately 5,000 acres. The lower Pomme de Terre River was rerouted into the reservoir at that time to facilitate construction of a two mile long earthen dike that was required to impound the lake. The Marsh Lake Dam is owned and maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Lac qui Parle Flood Risk Management project. Marsh Lake lies within the State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources Lac qui Parle Wildlife Management Area.Marsh Lake is the border between Big Stone and Lac qui Parle Counties, while most of the outlet area of Marsh Lake is located in Swift County. The original construction of the Marsh Lake Dam was intended to serve as a flood damage reduction measure and to provide a recreational feature to the region by creating a static pool on the river. The intended flood damage reduction benefits provided by the Marsh Lake Dam were minor due to effectiveness of the downstream Lac qui Parle Dam. Since the time of impoundment, Marsh Lake has undergone significant degradation of aquatic habitat due to stressors including high sediment and nutrient loading, a fixed crest dam that prevents low seasonal water levels, high turbidity from wind-driven sediment resuspension, and abundant common carp that increase turbidity and consume submersed aquatic vegetation and macroinvertebrates. Degradation of the Marsh Lake aquatic ecosystem limited habitat suitability for many species of fish and wildlife. The overall habitat conditions were poor with turbid water conditions. Concerns by stakeholders over the habitat conditions eventually resulted in the Marsh Lake Ecosystem Restoration Project with a primary goal of improving fish and wildlife habitat by returning the Marsh Lake to a less degraded and more natural condition with snatural functions and processes. Major project features include construction of a drawdown water control structure, restoring the Pomme de Terre River to its original channel, modifying the existing low-head dam into a notched weir/rock arch rapids fishway, and construction of one mile of new roadway/earthen dike. The project also restores 1.3 miles of natural stream habitat and provides complete fish passage from the Minnesota River into Marsh Lake. . Water Control Structure - The drawdown structure was constructed west of the existing emergency spillway. Excavation for the structure’s outflow channel extended about 650 feet downstream of the embankment. The intake for the structure required excavation to deepen the approach and placement of new rip‐rap to protect the structure. Sheetpile was buried under the concrete structure to minimize seepage. A 60‐ft long section of the channel bed immediately downstream of the concrete spillway was lined with a 33‐inch layer of rip‐rap over 12‐inch bedding. A 100‐ft long dredge maintenance access ramp was built from the top of the west embankment into Marsh Lake. The new water control structure will allow for water levels to be manipulated between and within years to promote habitat benefits, as has been successfully done on numerous shallow lakes across Minnesota and on Mississippi River pools. Variability in water levels has resulted in increased extent, diversity, and abundance of aquatic vegetation, increased food for waterfowl, and improved water quality conditions.   Re-routing of the Pomme de Terre River - The Pomme de Terre River was successfully re-routed into it's historic channel.  Two rock riffle structures were utilized to prevent head‐cutting in the river channel. Riffles were placed to traverse the entire river channel and were constructed with boulders, rip‐rap, and gravel. This provides a drop in the water surface elevation of about 8 inches.  The 1,000 feet of the bank of the Pomme de Terre River has been stabilized using toe wood sod mats. Large trees were placed in an interlocking matrix and anchored with boulders. Topsoil or soil mats were placed to fill the areas between trees and branches and shrubs and live willow cuttings were added.  An estimated 1.1 miles of existing roadway was removed as part of re-storing the Pomme de Terre River and its floodplain. Successful re-routing of the river now means the sediment and nutrients carried by the Pomme de Terre River no longer are emptied into Marsh Lake, but are instead diverted into the Minnesota River below the water control structure. Fishway - The fishway was constructed from the current spillway and extends about 300 feet downstream at a 3% slope. Boulder weirs were spaced 20 feet apart, with each achieving individual 10‐inch drops. The fishway ranges in width from 150 feet at the dam to 200 feet wide at the downstream edge. Approximately 1,579 cubic yards of large (1.6 ft diameter and larger boulders for weirs) were used in the fishway channel. The goal of the components listed above is to partially or fully reestablish the attributes of a naturally functioning and self-regulating system. The expected outcomes of the Marsh Lake project are to: (1) reduce sediment loading to Marsh Lake; (2) restore natural fluctuations to the hydrologic regime of Marsh Lake; (3) restore geomorphic and floodplain processes to the Pomme de Terre River; (4) reduce sediment resuspension within Marsh Lake; (5) increase extent, diversity, and abundance of emergent and submersed aquatic plant growth in Marsh Lake; (6) increase the availability of waterfowl and native fish habitat; (7) restore aquatic habitat connectivity between Marsh Lake, the Pomme de Terre River, and Lac qui Parle Lake; (8) reduce the abundance of aquatic invasive fish species in Marsh Lake; and (9) increase diversity and abundance of native fishes within Marsh Lake and the Pomme de Terre River. This project is designed to restore a more natural and variable hydrologic regime which is important to restoring freshwater aquatic ecosystems within Marsh Lake. On a river floodplain lake like Marsh Lake, a more natural hydrologic regime includes lower lake levels in some years to provide conditions conducive for aquatic vegetation to establish. In the event the goals in the Marsh Lake Ecosystem Restoration Plan are not achieved through the passive water control structure (i.e., fishway), a water level drawdown structure has been incorporated into the project where water levels could be drawn down according to recommendations and implementation by the adaptive management team. Annual and intra-annual variations in water levels are extremely important to maintain ecosystem functions in these shallow water systems. In other areas, (e.g., the pools in the Upper Mississippi River), variability in water levels has resulted in increased extent, diversity, and abundance of aquatic vegetation, increased food for waterfowl, and improved water quality conditions. The DNR Section of Wildlife has completed other projects to enhance habitat and water quality conditions within shallow lake systems through active water level drawdowns. A clear water system with more aquatic plants would favor native fishes over the non-native Common carp, as well as favor many other native plant and wildlife species. The proposed project will provide habitat improvement and improve water quality conditions in Marsh Lake. This restoration of ecosystem functions would improve fish and wildlife habitat, water quality, and provide more public use opportunities. Specific beneficiaries include sport anglers, waterfowl hunters, wildlife viewers, and downstream users who benefit from increased water quality downstream through the Minnesota River.   Water quality benefits will result from the completed work and from the future management that is now possible.  Rerouting of the Pomme de Terre into a meandering channel with adjacent floodplain habitat can provide some limited ability for sediment reduction as it flows into the Minnesota River.  Significant water quality benefits will result from the current ongoing drawdown of Marsh Lake, along with any future drawdowns.  Past experience with drawdowns of shallow lakes shows that the bottom-sediment consolidation and increased submergent vegetation provide significant water quality benefits both in the shallow lake and in downstream waters. Note that the ""Performance Monitoring and Adaptive Management Plan"" is attached to this Final Report and details the extensive monitoring that will be conducted on this project to determine progress towards goals. While COVID-19 restrictions have limited some initial monitoring, anecdotal reports from local staff reveal exciting developments related to the water level drawdown that was immediately initiated following completion of project construction - - From Walt Gessler (Lac qui Parle Area Wildlife Supervisor)  -  ""I was able to remotely recruit several experienced birders earlier this year to make observations of shorebird use of Marsh Lake this spring and summer and thought you be interested in some recent counts that were made.7/19/20 Louisburg Grade:  150 Killdeer, 4 Semipalmated Plovers, 40 Stilt Sandpipers, 30 Bairds Sandpipers, 100 Least Sandpiper, 460 Pectoral Sanpiper, 10 semipalmated Sandpipers, 20 Short-billed Dowitcher, 30 Spotted Sandpiper, 1450 Lesser Yellowlegs, 15 Greater Yellowlegs, 15 Wilsons Phalaropes.  2324 Total;     Correll Access:  2 American Avocets, 200 Killdeer, 172 Stilt Sandpipers, 15 Baird’s Sandpipers, 1280 Least Sandpipers, 340 Pectoal Sandpipers, 30 semi-palmated Sandpipers, 25 Short-billed Dowitcher, 30 spotted Sandpipers, 1800 Lesser Yellowlegs, 20 Greater Yellowlegs, 14 Wilson Phaloropes.   3928 total"" - From Ray Norrgard (DNR Wetland Specialist, retired)  08/21/2020 -  ""Walt gave me a tour yesterday, the drawdown looks good with extensive mudflats; thousands of shorebirds and teal.

The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources will be responsible for all active water level management, with consultation provided by an Adaptive Management Team that will include members from the Minnesota DNR, US Army Corps of Engineers, US Fish and Wildlife Service and Upper Minnesota River Watershed District.  A Citizen Advisory Committee has also been formed to help guide future operations and to provide better communication with the public regarding this high-profile project.

FMV sought to restore native habitats within the Refuge and to work in concert with the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and other partners on critical, publicly-owned habitat on Refuge lands. During this phase of the MeCC project, FMV and our partners were able to successfully restore and enhance 17 acres of native wet prairie, 48 acres of native dry sand-gravel oak savanna, and 28 acres of native dray sand-gravel prairie with Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund funds for a total acreage of 93 acres. We were also able to restore additional match acreage of 59 acres of native dry sand-gravel oak savanna with non-LCCMR, non-state funds, bringing total acres impacted by this project to 152 acres. The FMV objectives were to complement and connect habitat restoration and management of Refuge lands with that being done by other entities. Restoration sites were selected to address primary management issues and challenges, including the need to restore hydrology within floodplain communities and to restore upland communities such as native oak savanna and wet and dry prairies. Public access to restored lands for recreation and education and the assurance of permanent protection were also primary factors. Due to persistent flooding, our access to wetland sites was severely limited and, as a result, we shifted our focus to upland restoration, as reflected in our amended work program. All work was completed on four Refuge Units. Work included cutting and herbicide treatment of non-native woody brush species such as buckthorn, honeysuckle, prickly ash, eastern red cedar, and Siberian elm. Minnesotans will be able to access and appreciate the restored sites through the access and education provided to Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge visitors. Our project data is publicly accessible by contacting FMV, through information disseminated through our newsletter and on our website, and through information provided by the MeCC Partnership. Project Results Use and Dissemination As projects were completed, Friends of the Minnesota Valley publicized project accomplishments through the Friends' quarterly newsletter, our annual report, publication of a habitat restoration prospectus, and the posting of projects on our website. Other dissemination of information occurred through the Metro Conservation Corridors partnership and on the Metro Corridors website.

The principal strategies employed by the Program to achieve these goals included: 1) competitive grants to local and regional governments to restore degraded habitats; 2) competitive grants that support the acquisition of or conservation easements on strategically important parcels of terrestrial, wetland, or riparian habitat; 3) incentive grants to local governments to address other conservation needs such as land cover inventories, natural resource based land use decision tools, and ordinance revisions to support conservation efforts; and 4) natural resource based workshops on topics of interest to local government staff and officials. The 2009 appropriation concludes DNR Central region's Metro Greenways Program, which is sun setting after 13 years. This final allotment of $1,175,000 was used to fund a total of 21 projects and to develop and offer six new natural resource-based workshops. Combined, the restoration and protection projects conserved an additional 375 total acres in the 12-county greater metropolitan region, almost meeting Metro Greenways' combined target of 385 acres of lands restored and protected: Five restoration grants totaling $90,000 were awarded to three counties and one city. In combination with other funds, a total of approximately 255 acres of city, county, and regional park lands were restored to native vegetation, primarily prairie and savanna. The newly restored acreage was over two times more than targeted for this result (120 acres). Six protection projects were awarded a total of $650,000. Only three projects totaling $370,000 were initiated and completed (Lindstrom, Grannis, and Niebur), resulting in the protection of just 120 acres of the 325 acre projected target for Metro Greenways. The city of Lindstrom acquired a new 64 acre Allemansratt ""wilderness"" park that will give residents the chance to explore its several clear lakes and deciduous hardwood forest. Two grants to Dakota County added a total of 56 acres under conservation easements to its green infrastructure network being created by the Farmland and Natural Areas Program. Unfortunately, a $200,000 grant to Anoka Conservation District did not materialize and a $10,000 grant awarded to Chanhassen was turned down. These funds were put toward other projects. A Washington County project fell through very late in the biennium, leaving an $80,000 balance for this result category. Metro Greenways' Community Conservation Assistance Program awarded 13 grants to cities, counties and special districts that supported a variety of locally-specific conservation needs: a) to obtain land cover and urban tree canopy (UTC) inventories; b) to develop natural resource-based land use decision models; c) to create interjurisdictional partnerships to protect high quality natural areas; and d) to write new or revise existing ordinances to protect natural resources. In addition to these grants, the Program organized and facilitated two annual events (Rendez-Vous) that brought all DNR Community Assistance grantees (2008 and 2009 appropriations) together for full days of information-sharing and peer-to-peer learning. The DNR also convened the three cities undertaking urban tree canopy (UTC) inventories, along with the University of Minnesota forestry and extension service, U.S. Forestry Service, and Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, to hear about each city's findings and proposed applications of UTC data. This third result area also funded the development and offering of six new natural resource-based workshops in 2010/2011 for local government staff and appointed officials. These workshops were offered in the metro area and were promoted by Government Training Services to its clientele (local government commissioners). Almost 325 local government staff and officials (62% from cities; 14% counties; 10% townships; and14% special districts and others) attended these workshops on shoreland conservation, stormwater management, and the incorporation of natural resources into land use planning and engineering design. The workshops all received excellent evaluations from attendees. Project Results Use and Dissemination Press releases were sent to local newspapers where projects were funded. The DNR convened all of the Community Conservation Assistance (CCA) project managers in November of 2009 and in February 2011 to share the findings of their conservation work. CCA Project Profiles were drafted and posted on the DNR website. Protection and restoration project information is available through the Metro Conservation Corridor partnership map created for public use. The CCA deliverables will be tried and tested as part of the Results Outcomes effort by the State of Minnesota.

First, 80 acres were acquired (36.7 acres pro-rated to this appropriation) and added to the Hastings Sand Coulee SNA. The addition contains native oak savanna and prairie and increases this SNA to 267 acres. Thus, more than half of this largest remaining prairie complex in Dakota County is protected for its 13 resident rare species (including 3 snake and 2 butterfly species) and for public use, including hiking and nature observation. Second, about 70 acres - including public fishing frontage on the Credit River - was acquired (6.2 acres pro-rated to this appropriation) and added to the Savage Fen SNA in Scott County. These sites offer urban residents close-to-home nature-based recreation, including a new archery hunting opportunity on 300 acres at Savage Fen SNA. SNA restoration and enhancement activities were completed on 187 acres at 13 SNAs in 7 counties in the greater metropolitan area. For example, a 55-acre prairie was reconstructed (restored) at Lost Valley Prairie SNA with the help of volunteers and a Sentence-to-Serve crew using seed collected on site by hand and mechanically harvested by the SNA crew. Almost 100 acres was prescribed burned at 5 SNAs. About 34 acres received invasive species control actions, including work by Conservation Corps Minnesota.

Result 1 (4f2.9) focused on a trout stream habitat restoration project located within Vermillion River Aquatic Management Areas (AMA), in Dakota County. This stretch of the Vermillion River channel had been altered by ditching. Result 2 (4f3.5) focused on securing fee title parcels on the Vermillion River in Dakota County and Eagle Creek in Scott County. Parcels include habitat linkages that provided environmental protection of the shoreline and riparian zone, exhibit a high risk of development, supply angler access, and afford management access necessary for implementing habitat improvement projects. Project goals were to restore 0.6 miles of stream habitat and acquire 60 acres with 1.0 mile of shoreline. Partner funding includes donations of land value and cash. Result 1 (4f2.9): Restoration of 0.9 miles of Vermillion River channel. Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF) dollars directly restored approximately 0.44 miles of the total restored channel. Other State dollars (TU OHC = $140,000) restored 0.41 miles, and other funding (Vermillion River Watershed = $20,000) restored 0.05 miles of the total. Result 2 (4f3.5): Acquisition of four parcels with a grand total of approximately 50.5 acres and 1.1 miles of stream shoreline. Because of the extreme variation in shoreline values it is hard to accurately predict a reliable acre benchmark. Most years, including the 2008 ENRTF appropriation, we far exceeded our acres goal. For the 2009 ENRTF appropriation, we fell short of the acres goal, but reached our ""miles of shoreline"" goal. ENRTF directly acquired approximately 38.8 acres of the total, including 0.7 miles stream shoreline. Donations of land value (""other funds"" $106,800) accounted for 11.7 acres and 0.4 shoreline miles. One of the Vermillion River parcels (parcel 7) was acquired jointly using both 2008 and 2009 grants to Metro Corridors Conservation Partnership. Results for Vermillion River, P7 were proportionately distributed for each grant. Overall, as a result of this project, 0.9 miles of Vermillion River channel was restored to its original course, after being ditched for 50 or more years. Also, as a result of this project, 50.5 acres, including 1.1 miles of critical shoreline fish and wildlife habitat are now permanently protected and open to public angling and/or hunting - as well as other light use recreational activities. Due to failed negotiations, two acquisitions went into abeyance towards the end of the grant, resulting in $57,975 being turned back to the ENRTF.

Eight perpetual conservation easements were completed that collectively protect 765 acres of land and more than 13,000 feet of shoreline. Three easements were purchased, and the remaining five easements were donated. While two of the purchased easements used both 2009 and 2010 ENRTF funding, we are reporting the accomplishments as part of our 2009 report. We will not report these acres in future 2010 reports to avoid double-counting. All eight projects represent unique opportunities to protect high quality natural habitat, riparian areas, and to build upon prior land protection work by the Land Trust at several priority sites. The specific project sites of the conservation easements include: 45 acres, including 1,095 feet of shoreline, along Deer Lake in Anoka County (purchased using both ML 2009 and ML 2010 ENRTF appropriations); 148 acres, including 2,527 feet of shoreline, along Elk River in Sherburne County (donated); 44 acres, including 3,065 feet of shoreline, on Kingswood Pond in Hennepin County (purchased using both ML 2009 and ML 2010 ENRTF appropriations); 157 acres near Hardwood Creek in Washington County (donated); 5 acres in Scandia in Washington County (donated); 126 acres near the headwaters of Valley Creek in Washington County (donated); 39 acres adjacent to Wild River State Park in Chisago County (purchased using ML 2009 ENRTF appropriation only); 201 acres near Baypoint Park in Goodhue County (donated). Additionally, the Land Trust prepared baseline property reports for each easement, detailing the condition of the property for future monitoring and enforcement. To fund this required perpetual obligation, the Land Trust dedicated ENRTF and other funds to its segregated Stewardship and Enforcement Fund for all completed projects. We estimated the anticipated annual expenses of each project and the investment needed to generate annual income sufficient to cover these expenses in perpetuity - all in accordance with our internal policies and procedures as approved by LCCMR. We will report to LCCMR annually on the status of the Stewardship and Enforcement Fund and the easements acquired with funds from this grant. Values are known for only five of the eight easements acquired, and this value totals $854,500, with a known donated value of $413,500. The cost to the State of Minnesota to complete these projects was just over $326 per acre. Cumulatively, across phases I-V of the Metro Corridors program, the Land Trust has protected 3,298 acres of critical habitat and more than 75,000 feet of shoreline, at a cost to the State of $520 per acre. The Minnesota Land Trust's work on this project continues to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of working with conservation easements to protect natural and scenic resources within developed and developing areas, as the cost to the State was well below the cost to purchase land in the Twin Cities region. This grant continued to generate interest among landowners, and therefore, ongoing funding will be important to sustained success. Additionally, our experiences during this phase of the grant continue to indicate that funds to purchase easements, as opposed to obtaining donated easements, will be necessary in the future as work becomes more targeted, selective, and focused on building complexes of protected land. Project Results Use and Dissemination The Minnesota Land Trust disseminated information about the specific land protection projects completed under this grant though our newsletter, email updates, web site, and press releases. The Land Trust also shared information about conservation easements generally and our experience with our partner organizations, other easement holders, local communities, as well as policy makers including members of the LCCMR and L-SOHC.

Result 1 (4f2.9) focused on a trout stream habitat restoration project located within Vermillion River Aquatic Management Areas (AMA), in Dakota County. This stretch of the Vermillion River channel had been altered by ditching. Result 2 (4f3.5) focused on securing fee title parcels on the Vermillion River in Dakota County and Eagle Creek in Scott County. Parcels include habitat linkages that provided environmental protection of the shoreline and riparian zone, exhibit a high risk of development, supply angler access, and afford management access necessary for implementing habitat improvement projects. Project goals were to restore 0.6 miles of stream habitat and acquire 60 acres with 1.0 mile of shoreline. Partner funding includes donations of land value and cash. Result 1 (4f2.9): Restoration of 0.9 miles of Vermillion River channel. Environmental and Natural Resources Trust Fund (ENRTF) dollars directly restored approximately 0.44 miles of the total restored channel. Other State dollars (TU OHC = $140,000) restored 0.41 miles, and other funding (Vermillion River Watershed = $20,000) restored 0.05 miles of the total. Result 2 (4f3.5): Acquisition of four parcels with a grand total of approximately 50.5 acres and 1.1 miles of stream shoreline. Because of the extreme variation in shoreline values it is hard to accurately predict a reliable acre benchmark. Most years, including the 2008 ENRTF appropriation, we far exceeded our acres goal. For the 2009 ENRTF appropriation, we fell short of the acres goal, but reached our ""miles of shoreline"" goal. ENRTF directly acquired approximately 38.8 acres of the total, including 0.7 miles stream shoreline. Donations of land value (""other funds"" $106,800) accounted for 11.7 acres and 0.4 shoreline miles. One of the Vermillion River parcels (parcel 7) was acquired jointly using both 2008 and 2009 grants to Metro Corridors Conservation Partnership. Results for Vermillion River, P7 were proportionately distributed for each grant. Overall, as a result of this project, 0.9 miles of Vermillion River channel was restored to its original course, after being ditched for 50 or more years. Also, as a result of this project, 50.5 acres, including 1.1 miles of critical shoreline fish and wildlife habitat are now permanently protected and open to public angling and/or hunting - as well as other light use recreational activities. Due to failed negotiations, two acquisitions went into abeyance towards the end of the grant, resulting in $57,975 being turned back to the ENRTF. Acquired parcels are now designated and managed as AMAs. Project Results Use and Dissemination All new AMA lands will be added to DNR's Public Recreational Information Maps (PRIM).

","The three Big Rivers in the Metro Urbanizing Area, including their tributaries and natural resources within the watersheds, provide critical habitat that must be protected and improved for resident and migrating wildlife, both game and non-game species. In this first phase of work, the Metro Big Rivers Habitat Partnership protected 194 acres and enhanced 357 acres with the OHF grant. The partnership exceeded its original goal of enhancing 116 acres by 207%. It also protected an additional 257 acres with leveraged funding, for a total of 451 acres protected. The resources protected and enhanced by the Metro Big Rivers Partnership are under pressure because of population growth and the high amenity values associated with most, if not all, of these lands. All lands protected had been identified as high priorities through public planning processes by the public entities that will eventually own the properties or hold the easement, as follows: 1) MN Valley National Wildlife Refuge (USFWS) for the Refuge lands to be acquired; 2) Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) for the Savage Fen expansion, and 3) Dakota County and DNR for the conservation easement acquired to expand the Pine Bend Bluffs SNA. All lands enhanced were under public ownership. The enhancement work had been identified as a high priority by the public entities that owned the land, as follows – City of St. Paul (Parks and Recreation) for the restoration on the Mississippi blufflands at Indian Mounds and Cherokee Bluff and MN DNR for enhancement at Savage Fen, Seminary Fen, Pine Bend Bluffs SNA, Falls Creek SNA and Franconia Bluffs SNA. The public has access to all of the land protected through this program for wildlife-based outdoor recreation. In addition to accomplishing the projected outcomes, this phase provided learnings that will benefit future work, including: * At Pine Bend Bluffs SNA, Friends of the Mississippi River required buckthorn-removal contractors to use glyphosate herbicide, which has the least toxic impacts of the herbicides typically used to treat buckthorn. The buckthorn was cut and treated in late fall, while the plants were still biologically active. This is a departure from the standard practices that contractors use, as they more commonly cut buckthorn in winter and use an herbicide with an oil penetrant. While effective, that herbicide also has a long soil residual and kills surrounding vegetation. The results of the alternative treatment approach required by FMR were very good, estimated at 90% success rate, with very low amounts of re-sprouting occurring. * Great River Greening participated in the first year of restoration evaluations conducted by the DNR for OHF grant recipients. The project evaluated was at Cherokee Park in the City of St. Paul. The evaluation went smoothly, but would have benefited by including the landowner (St. Paul Parks) in the process. Understanding why certain activities took place is but half the answer; understanding how the benefits will be maintained is equally important, and landowners are key to that discussion.

FMR restored 8 acres of prairie and enhanced 30 acres prairie, 47 acres of wetland and 237 acres of forest on three sites in Dakota County and one in Washington County, as follows:• Gores Pool Wildlife Management Area (Freitag Tract) -- Gores Pool WMA is a 6,449-ac complex of floodplain forest, marshland and backwater along the Mississippi River and Vermillion River Bottoms in Dakota County. Most of the area is designated as outstanding biodiversity significance and constitutes one of the largest expanses of floodplain native plant communities in southeast Minnesota. It is also one of the top four sites in the state for rare forest birds. The 300 acre Freitag Tract was purchased in 2008 by the DNR in partnership with Dakota County and the City of Hastings. With this Phase 3 grant, FMR continued its activities at the WMA in partnership with the DNR, enhancing 47 acres of wet meadow, 125 acres of forest, and 5 acres of prairie. Methods included cutting and treating invasive woody and herbaceous species, prescribed burning, installing cottonwood livestakes, and planting native shrubs.• Hastings Sand Coulee Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) - This SNA is identified as significant by the Dakota County Farmland and Natural Area Program and the County Biological Survey. In addition to containing an intermittent stream that flows to the Vermillion River, this site contains rare dry prairie and associated oak woodland. Fourteen rare species have been documented at this SNA. FMR’s work with Phase 3 restored 8 acres of prairie, enhanced 23 acres of prairie by removing woody species and conducting prescribed burns and enhanced 51 acres of oak woodland by controlling exotic invasive species and conducting prescribed burns.• Hastings Scientific and Natural Area -- This 69-acre SNA, designated in the 1970s, is situated along the Mississippi – Vermillion River floodplain and blufflands in Hastings, Dakota County. It contains wetland, maple-basswood forest and floodplain forest. FMR developed a Natural Resource Management Plan for this SNA in 2011 in partnership with the DNR. With Phase 3 funds, FMR conducted exotic invasive woody plant control on 35 acres of forest by cutting and stump-treating. These activities improved the habitat for the both rare species and all the plant and animal members of these forest communities.• Camel’s Hump / Gateway North Open Space Area -- This 34-acre site sits on a high ancient river terrace of sandstone and limestone within Cottage Grove (Washington County). The natural communities located on this site include oak forest, bedrock bluff prairie and lowland hardwood forest. Through this Phase 3 grant, FMR prepared a Natural Resource Management Plan, then conduct woody plant removal and a prescribed burn on approximately 2-acres of prairie and exotic plant control on approximately 26 acres of forest by cutting and treating woody plants and prescribed burns. Seed collected from the prairie on-site was used to enhance other areas on-site.Great River Greening (GRG) also exceeded its original grant acres. GRG conducted enhancement activities on 179 acres (141 acres were originally proposed), as follows:• Katherine Abbott Park: 6 acres prairie enhancement, and16 acres forest enhancement. Work included: removal of invasive common and glossy buckthorn, honeysuckle, black locust and Siberian elm; woody encroachment removal from the native prairie; and reed canary grass control in the wet prairie area. The enhancement at Katherine Abbott is continuing with Trust Fund support and City support. This site now hosts remnant prairie, oak savanna, enhanced forest habitat, and enhanced wetland habitats. Acreage and habitat goals were met; with City funds, summer and fall 2017 burns are being developed for the oak woodland communities to control buckthorn and promote the remnant understory. • Fish Creek Open Space: 75 acres of dry-mesic prairie oak savannah were enhanced. Work included woody invasive removal, tree planting, and prairie seeding. Oak savanna was restored using an oak grove design, and the timing of seeding was selected carefully to encourage forb establishment for better pollinator habitat and floristic diversity, as well as a robust prairie grass component. The establishment has included mowing to promote prairie perennials over weedy annuals and biennials, and spot treatment (pulling, spraying) of more problematic non-native invasive species. Restorations involved Greening’s Summer Youth Job Corps (a partnership with Conservation Corps of Minnesota and Iowa, providing hands-on natural resource experience to underserved youth), students and faculty, volunteer citizens, contractors, and Greening staff. Fish Creek now hosts prairie habitat, oak savanna habitat, and enhanced forest habitat. This location in the Mississippi flyway is proving to continue to leverage volunteer services for enhancement and maintenance, and is also a pollinator citizen science project location with Trust Fund support. Acreage goals were met and maintenance program is robust and underway.• Springbrook Nature Center: 82 acres enhanced (66 acres proposed), 70 acres of forest and 12 acres of prairie, through woody invasive removal and treatment and several rounds of prescribed burns. Work was conducted by Greening’s Summer Youth Job Corps (see Fish Creek description), citizen volunteers, contractors, and Greening staff.With this grant, the Trust for Public Land (TPL) acquired 66 acres of a larger 335 acre acquisition of significant habitat in Elk River (Sherburne County) with over a mile of Mississippi River shoreline at the confluence of the Elk River and Mississippi Rivers.

This forest enhancement project at the confluence of the Elk and Mississippi Rivers in Sherburne County was on part of the land acquired with OHF funds by the Trust for Public Land (MBR Phases 2 and 3 / ML 2011 and 2012). A total of 90 acres were enhanced (exceeding the goal of 70 acres) through woody invasive species management, including forestry mowing, multiple herbicide treatments and native woodland grass and sedge seeding. These efforts dramatically transformed this site, which initially had such a dense sub-canopy of buckthorn that it prevented the regeneration of most other shrubs and trees. OHF funds were leveraged with $34,595 in other funds.  FMR is restoring and enhancing other parts of the Houlton Conservation Area through MBR phases 7 (restoration of 180 acre agricultural field) and MBR 8 (enhancement of 80 acres forest).     Great River Greening (GRG) exceeded its original goals by restoring and enhancing 187 acres total in Carver, Dakota, Hennepin and Ramsey Counties (159 acres were proposed). Leverage funds of $179,000 helped GRG enhance 30 acres of prairie and 157 acres, as follows:  •  Alimagnet Park - This forest enhancement project in Dakota County is complete and deliverables were met. A total of 20 acres of forest were enhanced through selective timber harvest, cutting of woody invasives, and multiple herbicide treatments on buckthorn and other invasive species. •  Carver Park Preserve - Goals were exceeded on this forest enhancement project in Carver County. A total of 90 acres of forest were enhanced (exceeding the goal by 20 acres) through woody invasive species management, including forestry mowing, herbicide applications and prescribed burning.   •  Pond Dakota Mission Park & Minnesota River Valley (City of Bloomington property) - This project along the Minnesota River in Hennepin County concluded in the spring of 2018 after crews completed a selective thinning of the forest canopy and removal of exotic tree and shrub species (buckthorn and honeysuckle).  Large material was hauled out of the valley while smaller material was piled and burned.  Over the course of the project, 22 acres were enhanced.   •  Terrace Oak Park - This forest enhancement project in Dakota County is complete and deliverables were met. A total of 19 acres of forest were enhanced through woody invasive species management, including forestry mowing and multiple herbicide treatments.   •  Trout Brook Nature Preserve - This prairie enhancement project in the Trout Brook Greenway in St. Paul was completed at the end of September 2017 and deliverables were met. 30 prairie acres were enhanced through woody invasive species removal, prairie establishment maintenance, woodland tree and shrub planting, and prairie pollinator nursery plot plantings.   The Minnesota Valley Trust (MVT) added 32.4 acres to the Rapids Lake Unit of the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge through two high-priority fee title acquisitions. Both parcels are adjacent to the Refuge and a DNR Wildlife Management Area that is managed by the USFWS.   These acquisitions protected significant oak savanna, remnant prairie, oak basswood forest and seasonal ephemeral wetlands from residential development. An initial BioBlitz in 2018 identified more than 200 species, including the endangered Henslow’s Sparrow, Bloodroot, Pasqueflower, Kittentail (a state threatened species), Buffalo Bean, Bergamot and Common, Whorled and Green Milkweeds. Bur Oaks with wide branching limbs are indicative of historic oak savanna.   The OHF grant of $600,000 was leveraged with (1) $679,863 in other, private funds to complete the 20.56-acre acquisition and (2) $449,345 in other, private funds to acquire the 11.83-acre parcel. Total leverage was $1,129,208.   Habitat restoration and enhancement will include removal of invasive woody species, seeding the former building sites and prescribed fire. After restoration, the property will be transferred to the USFWS and opened to the public for hunting and other wildlife-dependent recreational opportunities. The Minnesota Land Trust (MLT) and its partner, Washington County, were not successful in securing a conservation easement on property owned by the Manitou Fund at Terrapin Lake in Washington County. Discussions with the landowner took a step backward in fall 2017, prompting all parties to look for alternative ways to realize the mutual desires of ensuring long-term conservation of this important resource. In early 2018, the landowner approached MLT and Washington County with renewed interest but backed away again from the project. All of the funding through this grant to MLT was earmarked for this high-priority project. With the project not being finalized, we were unable to secure any deliverables for the grant and returned the majority of funding to the State.   The Trust for Public Land (TPL) was unable to spend most of this appropriation, as the owners of the prospective 194-acre addition to Bayport WMA unexpectedly changed their minds and signed a contract to sell the land to a developer. $20,000 in DNR Land Acquisition Costs was released to the DNR for their appraisal and administrative costs related to this project.

Over the past decade, Minnesota’s moose population has dramatically fallen, from an estimated 8,840 in 2006 to this year’s estimate of 3,710. Due to the declining population, the Minnesota Legislature directed the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to establish a Moose Advisory Committee (MAC) to make recommendations to form the basis of a Moose Management and Research Plan (Moose Plan).In 2011, DNR released the Moose Plan, which incorporated the recommendations of the MAC. This included extending to the Moose Plan the strategic vision of the MAC that guided them through their recommendation process:""Moose have intrinsic value and are recognized for their importance to Minnesota. To the greatest extent possible, moose shall be managed for ecological sustainability, hunting, and viewing opportunities.""The importance of moose to Minnesota is evidenced by the broad range of partners in this Collaborative, whose proposal aligns completely with the strategic vision set forth by the MAC and in the Moose Plan.Project partners are:Federal: Superior National Forest (SNF)State: DNRTribal: 1854 Treaty Authority; Fond du Lac BandCounties: Cook, Lake; St. LouisUniversity:University of Minnesota Duluth, Natural Resources Research Institute (UMD)Organizations:MDHA; the Nature Conservancy; Ruffed Grouse Society; Wildlife Management InstituteCollaborative partners will work together to choose sites with forest stands that are partially harvested, decadent, poorly stocked with trees, or provide such poor browse condition that they are of little or no benefit to moose. Selective, low intensity planting of conifers on some parcels will eventually lead to more cover interspersed with browse. In the longer term, establishment of conifers will provide thermal and escape cover. Ultimately, this project will encourage a heterogeneous habitat matrix resulting in a healthier landscape that is more resilient, providing for an ecologically diverse and balanced landscape condition with greater benefit to moose and a number of species of greatest conservation need.In a draft technical report on Phase I of this project entitled, “Site Verification of Moose Habitat Restoration,” (UMD Report, attached), Ronald Moen, Ph.D. and John Frisch, M.S., evaluated the response of browse species and moose to habitat management. The report indicated that moose increased use of areas with habitat restoration and enhancement, whether the habitat restoration and enhancement was small-scale or large-scale. Similar conclusions were reached by Christina Maley in a 2017 report for the 1854 Treaty Authority (attached).The project has enabled moose habitat management on smaller units in areas where large scale management is not possible. The habitat management has resulted in moose use even though these areas have been classified as low moose density in the aerial moose survey.Collaborative partners now seek to enhance nearly 10,000 additional acres of moose foraging habitat by brush shearing, prescribed burning, selective planting and through timber harvest (funded by partners).",,2018-07-01,,"Outdoor Heritage Fund","In Progress",,,Craig,Engwall,"MN Deer Hunters Association","460 Peterson Road ","Grand Rapids",MN,55744,"(218) 327-1103",craig.engwall@mndeerhunters.com,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Cook, Lake, St. Louis","Northern Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-moose-habitat-collaborative-phase-iii,,,,

Furthermore, some habitats have declined in many areas, including long-lived-conifers, young-forest, and large-patch habitats. These habitats are critical for numerous game and non-game species of concern. Through enhancements applied to 2,465 acres of degraded forests, the proposed project will increase long-lived conifers, young forest gaps, riparian forest complexity, and patch-size diversity. By acting today, we can improve the health and resilience of our forests for all the benefits they provide. ","In northern Minnesota, hundreds of thousands of acres of forest are now in poor condition with diminished value for both wildlife and forest health. Long-lived conifers and early successional habitats have declined in many areas. Rapidly changing economic conditions plus threats such as invasive species, disease, a warming climate, fragmentation, and habitat loss pose great challenges for forest and wildlife managers. Over time, forest health issues tend to become more difficult and expensive to reverse. Significant investments in Minnesota’s forests are urgently needed now to improve forest health for wildlife, clean water, cultural values, and local economies. Major goals of this project are to: •Enhance forest productivity in degraded stands to benefit forest wildlife•Enhance riparian and upland forests to improve water quality and fish habitat•Enhance tree species, age-class, and patch size diversity to improve habitat and increase forest resilienceThis work will build on the strong partnerships and on-the-ground results produced over the past 20 years. Since 2009, TNC-supervised projects planted over 3 million trees across 15,000 acres of forests and have applied numerous enhancement treatments to those acres. The proposed project builds on this foundation. Enhancement activities will include:•Site preparation including shearing and brush cutting •Brush removal around seedlings•Coordinating activities across multiple landowners to maintain or increase both young and mature forest patch size•Browse protection•Prescribed burning•Black Ash stand diversification to prepare for Emerald Ash BorerWe used a collaborative approach to identify sites and expect to include additional county, tribal, and industry partners over time. Sites included in this proposal are on US Forest Service, DNR, Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe, and Beltrami and St. Louis County lands.

Other partners include the American Bird Conservancy, the Minnesota Deer Hunters Association, the Wildlife Management Institute, The Minnesota Land Trust, Trout Unlimited, the Ruffed Grouse Society, and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. To implement the project, a new forest restoration position will coordinate management with landowners, supervise contractors and contracting crews, and strengthen local partnerships. This position will be supervised by existing staff and will be advised by a core team of partners. Project sites will focus on core, priority areas with additional, smaller satellite sites or “stepping stones” that provide good opportunities for expansion in the future.

This proposal took the first steps to achieve these goals by initiating a comprehensive, coordinated and collaborative prairie conservation initiative. Annual investments by the LSOHC will be required to realize these ultimate outcomes. Results from this initial phase include: protection of 1,683 acres of native prairie, savanna, and other grasslands; restoration of 168 acres of diverse, local ecotype grassland; enhancement of 20,282 acres of grassland/savanna by prescribed fire, invasive species removal, and/or conservation grazing; and development of a new conservation model in 2 parts of the state that serve as a platform for accelerated conservation across Minnesota.","Design and Scope of Work 1. Problems to be addressed: the conservation problems facing Minnesota’s prairies, prairie potholes, grasslands and savannas are many, and include: a.Continued losses of native and restored grasslands due to economic pressures. b.Degradation of existing public grasslands and wetlands due to encroachment by woody vegetation and other invasive species that reduces their values to wildlife and people. c.Inadequate public access for hunting and fishing in agricultural parts of the state. d.Potential loss of local taxes and local incomes when land is acquired by public entities. e.Long-term state obligations for management of public lands and payment-in-lieu-of-taxes creates a burden for state budget. f.Programmatic and staff limitations that reduce efficiencies in implementing diverse conservation programs across multiple partners. 2. Scope of work: with the appropriated funding, and with other funds leveraged by this money and brought by other partners, the following actions and outcomes were realized. •The “Prairie Recovery Project Partnership” was initiated within the Glacial Lakes and Tallgrass Aspen Parkland's landscapes. Two prairie biologists were hired and co-located in partner offices to facilitate and oversee enhancement work on publicly owned grasslands. Dedicated protection staff were employed to identify priority parcels for permanent protection, conduct outreach with landowners, and bring real estate transactions to fruition. A project coordinator oversaw implementation of the above activities, and provided administrative support for budget monitoring and reporting. •Original goals for the project included 1,000 acres protected, 250 acres restored and 8,000 acres enhanced. We vastly exceeded our protection and enhancement goals with 1,683 acres permanently protected (including 1,026 acres native prairie) and 20,282 acres of permanently protected grasslands enhanced. Protected lands are held by The Nature Conservancy and are open to public hunting and fishing as provided in the Constitution. Management techniques on grassland enhancement projects included prescribed fire, conservation grazing and/or haying, removal of woody vegetation, and control of exotic invasive species. This work was accomplished through contracts with private vendors and through use of seasonal crews employed by the Conservancy. We accomplished 67% of our restoration goals through the restoration of 168 acres former cropland and degraded grassland to diverse native species. •A separate restricted internal fund was established by The Nature Conservancy to hold income generated from OHF funded acquisitions. Income generated by agricultural leases (grazing, haying and/or cropping), earned interest, public contributions and donations are held in this account and are used to pay for property taxes and ongoing management costs. This model was originally devised to test the principle of utilizing extractive practices (ie haying and grazing, native seed production) as a method for offsetting land holding and management costs. Through the project we have found that revenues generated lag behind holding costs, thereby necessitating private contributions on the part of the Conservancy for making property tax payments. And while the model does not function as effectively as we had originally hoped, economic activities do help at least partially offset ownership costs and can serve as valuable tools for implementing needed management. •On-the-ground staff provided by this grant convened and are leading coordination and implementation of local technical teams called for in the MN Prairie Conservation Plan; actively identified protection, restoration and enhancement needs and opportunities within the focus areas; worked with DNR and FWS staff to delineate conservation projects on public lands; coordinated deployment of contract and staff resources to protected conservation lands; worked with private landowners to coordinate agricultural activities/leases on appropriate protected conservation lands (e.g., haying, grazing, cropping); educated lessees on appropriate conservation grazing/haying practices; supervised management of lands acquired above; planned and conducted prescribed burns; and secured other funding for conservation practices, including through the MN DNR's Working Lands Initiative. •Contracts were let with Conservation Corps of Minnesota and private vendors to conduct enhancement activities on new and existing protected conservation lands, greatly expanding current capacity. These activities greatly improved the habitat value of public lands that were not receiving adequate management treatment, while simultaneously providing jobs for MCC and local businesses. Activities included removal of undesirable woody vegetation, identification and treatment of invasive species infestations, removal of abandoned fences and/or other structures, and related restoration/enhancement activities. 3. How priorities were set: prioritization and prioritization criteria varied with the conservation tactic being employed (i.e., protection, restoration, enhancement). Focus areas were selected where there was overlap with Core and Corridor landscapes as defined through the MN Prairie Conservation Plan and Conservancy priority areas. Because this is a collaborative effort involving multiple partners, tactical priorities and criteria were established at both the state and local level by the respective Local Technical Teams and local agency personnel. Criteria for each of these tactics included: a.Protection: location/proximity to other habitats, location/proximity to other protected lands, presence of rare/endangered species, imminence of conversion, ability to support grazing, size, cost, and likelihood for leveraged funding. b.Restoration: feasibility/likelihood of success, location, cost, availability of seed, and availability of restoration technical assistance. c.Enhancement: urgency/time since last enhancement, feasibility of success, accessibility, availability of enhancement technical assistance, cost, proximity to other habitats and partnership benefits. 4. Urgency and opportunity of this proposal: about 1% of Minnesota’s original native prairie still remains (about 200,000 acres of an original 1.8 million), and the remnants are still being destroyed and degraded today. Less than half is currently protected from conversion, and management capacity is unable to address needs. Additionally, more than 90% of the original prairie pothole wetlands in the western part of the state have also been lost. These losses threaten the viability of Minnesota’s prairie/wetland wildlife and recreational opportunities that depend upon them. Further, huge strides that have been made in supplementing habitat with the Conservation Reserve Program continue to be in imminent danger of being lost as contracts expire. Conservationists have a narrow window of opportunity to protect remaining native grasslands, wetlands and other habitats, restore and protect supplemental grasslands and wetlands, and accelerate enhancement efforts to ensure these habitats are providing optimal value to animals and people. This proposal accelerates an initiative begun last year, and expands efforts into 2 new focus areas where maximum benefits can be realized. 5. Stakeholder involvement and/or opposition: We have worked very closely with conservation interests in developing this initiative and will continue to collaborate with numerous partners.

Scope of work: With the requested funding, and with other funds leveraged by this money and brought by other partners, the following actions and outcomes were acheived.“Phase 3” built upon the success of the MN Prairie Recovery Project Phase 1 and 2 by continuing and expanding enhancement work in 4 focal areas and protection in 5 areas. Project partners, primarily through our participation in Prairie Plan Local Technical teams, helped us to prioritize and refine guidelines for protection, enhancement and restoration activities within priority landscapes. The Prairie Recovery Program utilizes a collaborative model for conservation and we regularly consult and work with a variety of entities including state and federal agencies, other conservation nonprofits, agricultural producer groups and local governments.1,425 acres of existing and restorable grassland, prairie pothole complex, and savanna was permanently protected within prairie core and corridor areas as identified in the MN Prairie Conservation Plan 2010. Lands will be held by The Nature Conservancy, subject to a recorded notice of funding restrictions pursuant to the grant with the MN DNR. All lands acquired in fee are FULLY open to hunting and fishing per state of Minnesota regulations. Basic developments have been, and will continue to be, implemented (boundary signage, habitat improvement, wetland restoration). Protection efforts were coordinated with other partner protection programs (e.g., DNR Wildlife Management Area and Prairie Bank programs), once again primarily through interactions through Local Technical Teams.A separate and discrete internal fund has been established by The Nature Conservancy to cover ongoing land-management costs.  Income generated by agricultural leases (grazing, haying, native seed harvest, and/or cropping) are held in this account and used to pay for property taxes and ongoing management costs.110 acres of cropland were restored to diverse, local-ecotype grassland or grassland/wetland complex. Preference was given to local producers and contractors for provision of seed and establishment of prairies to promote creation of local conservation-oriented businesses.22,298 acres of grassland complex were enhanced on public lands and those purchased with OHF funds and held by the Conservancy (“protected conservation lands”) to increase native species diversity and improve critical wildlife habitat. Management techniques included prescribed fire (61 projects totalling 15,016 acres), removal of woody vegetation (60 projects for 1,678 acres), and control of exotic species (83 projects - 5,514 acres). Much of this work was accomplished by private vendors through contracts. We also extensively used Conservation Corps of Minnesota (CCM) crews and seasonal staff employed directly by TNC.On-the-ground Conservancy staff provided by this grant were co-located in DNR or Fish and Wildlife Service offices and helped form and lead local coordination and implementation teams; identified protection, restoration and enhancement needs and opportunities within the focus areas; worked with DNR and FWS staff to delineate conservation projects on public lands; coordinated deployment of contract and staff resources to protected conservation lands; contacted and worked with private landowners to coordinate agricultural activities/leases on appropriate protected conservation lands (e.g., haying, grazing, cropping in advance of restoration); educated lessees on appropriate conservation grazing/haying practices; supervised management of lands acquired above; planned and conducted prescribed burns; and other activities related to prairie conservation in the focus areas. Contracts were let to provide a high level of enhancement activities to new and existing protected conservation lands, greatly expanding current capacity. These activities greatly improved the habitat value of public lands that were not receiving adequate management treatment, while simultaneously providing jobs for CCM and local businesses. Activities included removal of undesirable woody vegetation, identification and treatment of invasive species infestations, removal of abandoned fences and/or other structures, and related restoration/enhancement activities.To ensure goals and outcomes are consistently achieved across all 4 project areas, the project coordinator oversaw implementation of the above activities and provided administrative support for budget monitoring and reporting. Significant marketing and media outreach was conducted by the Conservancy to highlight the goals and accomplishments of the project to local and statewide constituents, as well as elected officials. http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/minnesota/policy/minnesota-prairie-recovery-project.xmlTemporary seasonal crews were employed by the Conservancy to provide additional capacity for public land management during critical periods like spring burn season. These crews helped create flexibility for enhancement projects and maximized the ability of specialized skilled personnel like burn bosses to increase the number of acres annually enhanced.2. How priorities were set: Prioritization and prioritization criteria vary with the conservation tactic being employed (i.e., protection, restoration, enhancement). Focus areas were selected where there was overlap with MN County Biological Survey prairie “focus areas” and TNC priority areas. Each of the 4 project locations directly correlate to core areas identified in the 2010 MN Prairie Conservation Plan. Because this project is a collaborative effort involving multiple partners, tactical priorities and criteria were established at both the state and local level by respective coordinating groups. criteria for each of these tactics include:a. Protection: location/proximity to other habitats, location/proximity to other protected lands, presence of rare/endangered species, imminence of conversion, ability to support grazing, size, cost, and likelihood for leveraged funding. A more robust listing of selection criteria can be provided upon request.b. Restoration: feasibility/likelihood of success, location, cost, availability of seed, and availability of restoration technical assistance, proximity to other habitats, and their ability to buffer or increase the conservation value of other protected lands.c. Enhancement: urgency/time since last enhancement, feasibility of success, accessibility, availability of enhancement technical assistance, cost, proximity to other habitats and partnership benefits.3. Urgency and opportunity of this proposal: Only about 1% of Minnesota’s original native prairie still remains (about 235,000 acres of an original 1.8 million), and the remnants are still being destroyed and degraded. Less than half of those 235,000 acres are currently protected from conversion, and management capacity is unable to address needs on protected lands. Additionally, more than 90% of the original prairie pothole wetlands in the western part of the state have also been lost. These losses threaten the viability of Minnesota’s prairie/wetland wildlife and recreational opportunities that depend upon them. Further, huge strides that have been made in supplementing habitat with the Conservation Reserve Program are in imminent danger of being lost as contracts expire. Conservationists have a narrow window of opportunity to protect remaining native grasslands, wetlands and other habitats, restore and protect supplemental grasslands and wetlands, and accelerate enhancement efforts to ensure these habitats are providing optimal value to animals and people. This proposal accelerated an initiative begun in 2010.4. Stakeholder involvement and/or opposition: This Phase continues an initiative begun with OHF funding in 2010. We have worked very closely with conservation interests in developing and maintaining this initiative and will continue close collaboration among partners. Via past and ongoing projects, we are also coordinating with other stakeholders (e.g., cattlemen’s associations, Land Stewardship Project, county boards), and will continue to seek opportunities to expand that coordination. Points of opposition that have risen to date include: perceived loss of tax revenues, philosophical opposition to public land ownership, and lack of understanding of processes (i.e. prescribed fire) necessary for long-term prairie system health. To address these concerns we have been actively engaged with county boards and other local units of government, local agricultural producers and groups, and local communities. We anticipate continuing to build these relationships in each of the four project areas.PlanningThis project implements strategies identified in at least 6 plans, as identified below.1. The 2010 MN Prairie Conservation Plan (Plan) identifies three distinct strategies and opportunities for targeting protection, restoration, and enhancement of Minnesota’s prairie and grassland systems. The plan recommends work in “Core Areas” defined as large landscapes that retain some features of functioning prairie systems. Using MN County Biological Survey data and USFWS Habitat Assessment, Populations and Evaluation Team (HAPET)2. MN Statewide Conservation and Preservation Plan. The strategic framework of this plan has 5 elements in its “Habitat” section: integrated planning, critical land protection, land and water restoration and protection, (identification of) sustainable practices, and (provision of) economic incentives for sustainable practices. Further, while the plan does not go into great detail with respect to prairie conservation, it clearly states that “protection of priority land habitats” is a vital practice, and prairies clearly fall here.  The Plan identifies 36 distinct prairie core areas across the western third of the state. Collectively these core landscapes contain 71% of the state’s remaining native prairie. All 4 of the project focus areas directly correlate with one or more of these core areas.3. Tomorrow’s Habitat for the Wild and Rare. The primary objective identified in the MN DNR’s plan is to “stabilize and increase populations of “species in greatest conservation need (SGCN)”. In the prairie regions of Minnesota, strategies to achieve this goal include:a. Support incentives that avoid conversion of grasslands into row crops where SGCN occur.b. Use mowing, cutting woody vegetation, prescribed fire, or careful use of herbicides to prevent the invasion of grasslands by trees and shrubs.c. Lengthen the cutting rotations for hay; avoid early-season mowing.d. Use light to moderate, rotational grazing programs to benefit SGCNe. Prevent fragmentation of grassland habitat.f. Avoid soil compaction in areas occupied by mammal SGCN.g. Increase native plant species components.h. Control spread of invasive species to adjacent native-dominated sites.This project proposes to address all but item “f” above.4. The Nature Conservancy’s Northern Tallgrass Prairie Ecoregional Plan (1998). This plan identifies key conservation targets, geographic emphasis areas, threats to native plant and animal communities, and key strategies to mitigate these threats. The proposal is a solid step in the implementation of this plan. Also, as a step-down from the NTP Ecoregion Plan, the Chapter has completed local level planning (Conservation Action Planning) for smaller geographic units that correspond with the focus areas. Goals within these focus areas are very explicit in identifying conservation targets and actions and are consistent with the activities contained in this proposal.5. DNR’s Pheasant Plan. This proposal is in full support of the Pheasant Plan goal to add 1.5 million acres of undisturbed grassland to the state by 2025.6. DNR’s Waterfowl Plan. This proposal is in full support of the state Long-range Duck Recovery Plan to add 2 million acres of habitat to the state by 2025. It also utilizes establishment of complexes, as per the plan, to achieve multiple conservation synergies and benefits.This plan helps fulfill multiple priorities specified by the LSOHC “Prairie Section Vision”, including permanent protection of existing prairies and wetlands, restoration of prairie and wetland habitats, building grassland/wetland complexes in blocks sufficient to increase migratory breeding bird success, enhancement of public lands for game species and other species of conservation need, and protection of watersheds of shallow lakes.

The Collaborative has also planted over two million trees including white spruce, white pine, jack pine, and white cedar.",,"Improving moose browse calls for treatments that regenerate preferred brush and tree species. In some places, this happens naturally. The area burned by the 2011 Pagami Creek fire is an example of this and is providing some excellent moose browse according to biologists. Most logging on uplands results in some regeneration of moose browse. However, there are tens of thousands of acres in moose range that will not see a natural browse regenerating event like fire or do not have enough volume of merchantable wood to make an economical timber sale. In these areas, the Collaborative used bulldozers, brush saw crews, and prescribed fires to shear, cut, and burn the old decadent brush and stimulate re-growth that is more palatable, nutritious, and easy to reach for moose.Cover for hiding from predators and protection from the elements is another part of the habitat equation. Research has shown that moose prefer forests with mixed conifer and deciduous trees. The pre-settlement forest in Northeast Minnesota was 70% conifers and 30% deciduous trees. Today that ratio is completely reversed with 70% deciduous and only 30% conifers. Improving cover habitat for moose means restoring conifers on the landscape. The Collaborative has planted over two million trees including white spruce, white pine, jack pine, and white cedar. The pine and cedar must be protected from browsing by deer and hare using budcaps or tree shelters. By the third year after planting, the seedlings need to be released from competition from surrounding trees and brush. This “release” is completed with brush saws which both helps the trees get established and produces another flush of future moose browse.A look at plat books for counties in Northeast Minnesota emphasizes the need for inter-agency partnerships to produce habitat results at a meaningful scale. The ownership pattern looks like a patchwork quilt of County, Federal, and State lands (private as well, but funds for this project are limited to public lands). There was not an acre that was worked on without some level of collaboration and cooperation between partner staff. The first cut at site selection was made by looking at forest inventory data and local knowledge of potential project areas. With time and experience, Collaborative partners have refined the search for good moose habitat projects and added and dropped stands as field visits were conducted. Proposals for specific work plans at each site were shared with wildlife biologists for their approval as beneficial to moose. Partners decided who would manage the bidding and contracting, order necessary supplies, supervise the work, complete the documentation needed for invoicing, track the specifics of what was done at each site, and summarize accomplishments for grant reporting and other communication about the project as a whole. As the grant recipient, MDHA is ultimately responsible for the finances and reporting to the Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council. But, the work it takes to produce results involves many of the partnering agencies.The variety of combinations of roles and responsibilities between staff from MDHA, the Superior National Forest, Lake County Forestry, DNR, The Nature Conservancy, and the 1854 Treaty Authority that played out in completing the work was impressive. For example, Lake County Forestry may identify a potential project on lands they manage, a Forest Service biologist may review and approve it as a good moose project, the 1854 Treaty Authority might collect pre-treatment data that is being used to track effectiveness, The Nature Conservancy may order the trees and line up the planting crew, Lake County supervises the work, The Nature Conservancy again handles the documentation and site-specific data and finally MDHA pays the contractor’s invoice and then requests reimbursement in the form of State managed grant funds.Early sampling and aerial surveys conducted by the 1854 Treaty Authority, U of M’s Natural Resources Research Institute, and other agency and tribal biologists are showing that moose are preferentially using the sites that were treated.",2012-07-01,2016-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Jenny,Foley,"Minnesota Deer Hunters Association","460 Peterson Road","Grand Rapids",MN,55744,218-327-1103,kimn@mndeerhunters.com,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Cook, Lake, St. Louis","Northern Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-moose-habitat-collaborative,,,,

SWCDs marketed the program to landowners, completed an initial review of eligibility and scoring, and submitted applications to BWSR for funding consideration. Subsequent signups were announced and held to fund additional easements, which followed a similar process of screening committee review and allocation of funding to funded applications. Summer 2012: BWSR completed first funding allocations to applications. Applications first underwent an eligiblity review and confirmation that sites met appropriation guidelines.

When combined with Phase 1 of the Program we have cumulatively protected 2,645 acres, enhanced 35,836 acres and restored 204 acres using OHF funds. We will continue to implement subsequent Phases toward meeting the conservation goals described in the MN Prairie Conservation Plan.",,"Design and Scope of Work 1. Problems to be addressed: the conservation problems facing Minnesota’s prairies, prairie potholes, grasslands and savannas are many, and include: a.Continued losses of native and restored grasslands due to economic pressures. b.Degradation of existing public grasslands and wetlands due to encroachment by woody vegetation and other invasive species that reduces their values to wildlife and people. c.Inadequate public access for hunting and fishing in agricultural parts of the state. d.Potential loss of local taxes and local incomes when land is acquired by public entities. e.Long-term state obligations for management of public lands and payment-in-lieu-of-taxes creates a burden for state budget. f.Programmatic and staff limitations that reduce efficiencies in implementing diverse conservation programs across multiple partners. 2. Scope of work: with the appropriated funding, and with other funds leveraged by this money and brought by other partners, the following actions and outcomes were realized. •The “Prairie Recovery Project Partnership” was initiated within the Upper MN River Valley and Aggasiz Beach Ridges and continued in the Glacial Lakes and Tallgrass Aspen Parklands landscapes. Two additional prairie biologists were hired and co-located in partner offices to facilitate and oversee enhancement work on publicly owned grasslands. Dedicated protection staff continued to identify priority parcels for permanent protection, conduct outreach with landowners, and bring real estate transactions to fruition. A project coordinator oversaw implementation of the above activities, and provided administrative support for budget monitoring and reporting. •Original goals for the project included 1,200 acres protected, 250 acres restored and 6,000 acres enhanced. We fell short of our overall protection goals with 962 acres permanently protected. The shortfall was due to the fact that a number of quality projects arose in the central part of the start, specifically Pope and Kandiyohi counties, where land prices are considerably higher than other parts of the prairie region. Protected lands are held by The Nature Conservancy and are open to public hunting and fishing. We greatly exceeded our enhancement goals with 15,435 acres of permanently protected grasslands managed. Management techniques on grassland enhancement projects included prescribed fire, conservation grazing and/or haying, removal of woody vegetation, and control of exotic invasive species. This work was accomplished through contracts with private vendors and through use of seasonal crews employed by the Conservancy. Three of the five protection projects will require future restoration and are in various stages of site preparation. •A separate restricted internal fund is established by The Nature Conservancy to hold income generated from OHF funded acquisitions. Income generated by agricultural leases (grazing, haying and/or cropping), earned interest, public contributions and donations are held in this account and are used to pay for property taxes and ongoing management costs. This model was originally devised to test the principle of utilizing extractive practices (ie haying and grazing, native seed production) as a method for offsetting land holding and management costs. Through the project we have found that revenues generated lag behind holding costs, thereby necessitating private contributions on the part of the Conservancy for making property tax payments. And while the model does not function as effectively as we had originally hoped, economic activities do help at least partially offset ownership costs and can serve as valuable tools for implementing needed management. •On-the-ground staff provided by this grant convened and are leading coordination and implementation of local technical teams called for in the MN Prairie Conservation Plan; actively identified protection, restoration and enhancement needs and opportunities within the focus areas; worked with DNR and FWS staff to delineate conservation projects on public lands; coordinated deployment of contract and staff resources to protected conservation lands; worked with private landowners to coordinate agricultural activities/leases on appropriate protected conservation lands (e.g., haying, grazing, cropping); educated lessees on appropriate conservation grazing/haying practices; supervised management of lands acquired above; planned and conducted prescribed burns; and secured other funding for conservation practices, including through the MN DNR's Working Lands Initiative. •Contracts were let with Conservation Corps of Minnesota and private vendors to conduct enhancement activities on new and existing protected conservation lands, greatly expanding current capacity. These activities greatly improved the habitat value of public lands that were not receiving adequate management treatment, while simultaneously providing jobs for MCC and local businesses. Activities included removal of undesirable woody vegetation, identification and treatment of invasive species infestations, removal of abandoned fences and/or other structures, and related restoration/enhancement activities. 3. How priorities were set: prioritization and prioritization criteria varied with the conservation tactic being employed (i.e., protection, restoration, enhancement). Focus areas were selected where there was overlap with Core and Corridor landscapes as defined through the MN Prairie Conservation Plan and Conservancy priority areas. Because this is a collaborative effort involving multiple partners, tactical priorities and criteria were established at both the state and local level by the respective Local Technical Teams and local agency personnel. Criteria for each of these tactics included: a.Protection: location/proximity to other habitats, location/proximity to other protected lands, presence of rare/endangered species, imminence of conversion, ability to support grazing, size, cost, and likelihood for leveraged funding. b.Restoration: feasibility/likelihood of success, location, cost, availability of seed, and availability of restoration technical assistance. c.Enhancement: urgency/time since last enhancement, feasibility of success, accessibility, availability of enhancement technical assistance, cost, proximity to other habitats and partnership benefits. 4. Urgency and opportunity of this proposal: about 1% of Minnesota’s original native prairie still remains (about 200,000 acres of an original 1.8 million), and the remnants are still being destroyed and degraded today. Less than half is currently protected from conversion, and management capacity is unable to address needs. Additionally, more than 90% of the original prairie pothole wetlands in the western part of the state have also been lost. These losses threaten the viability of Minnesota’s prairie/wetland wildlife and recreational opportunities that depend upon them. Further, huge strides that have been made in supplementing habitat with the Conservation Reserve Program continue to be in imminent danger of being lost as contracts expire. Conservationists have a narrow window of opportunity to protect remaining native grasslands, wetlands and other habitats, restore and protect supplemental grasslands and wetlands, and accelerate enhancement efforts to ensure these habitats are providing optimal value to animals and people. This phase built upon an initiative begun with our Prairie Recovery Project Phase 1, and expanded efforts into 2 new focus areas. 5. Stakeholder involvement and/or opposition: We have worked very closely with conservation interests in developing this initiative and will continue to collaborate with numerous partners.

While they are often the highest quality aquatic systems remaining in the state, and prized by both anglers and the general public because of this, many have badly degraded habitat. Given their relatively scarcity, being just six percent of total stream and river miles, this is a conservation issue of statewide importance that requires accelerated investment in projects which enhance or restore this habitat. This year we have a fleeting opportunity to leverage more than $2 million in other funds and convert isolated bank stabilization efforts in the Duluth area into comprehensive, enduring trout habitat restoration projects. Minnesota Trout Unlimited (“MNTU”) proposes to improve degraded habitat on numerous priority streams located on existing AMAs and public land around the state. Our members have demonstrated the capacity to complete these projects with Fiscal Year 2016 funding from the Outdoor Heritage Fund (“OHF”). MNTU respectfully proposes to partner with the Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council and the citizens of Minnesota to enhance habitat in and along the following public waters (in these counties): 1. Amity Creek (St. Louis) 2. East Branch of Amity Creek (St. Louis) 3. West Branch of Amity Creek (St. Louis) 4. Chester Creek (St. Louis) 5. Stewart River (Lake) 6. Vermillion River (Dakota) 7. Root River (Fillmore) 8. Numerous other streams (prioritized vegetation maintenance list)Individual project descriptions are provided in an attachment.Goals and scope of work.The goals of the projects include to increase the carrying capacity and trout population of the stream, increase angling access and participation, improve water quality and provide other benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. FY 2016 funded projects will use methods similar to those used on successful projects recently completed by MNTU chapters. MNTU will leverage our experience to optimize project design and implementation. We will also partner with Lake County Land Department as part of a watershed scale project to restore forest cover in riparian areas, improve hydrology and groundwater base flow, and thereby sustain and improve coldwater fisheries in the Stewart River watershed.In consultation with professionals within the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (“MNDNR”), MNTU will use the best available stream restoration and coldwater aquatic science to select specific habitat improvement methods for each stream that reflect the distinct characteristics of the watershed and ecological region, address the specific limiting factors (e.g. spawning substrate, adult cover, invertebrate production, etc.), and account for the land use practices.Objectives: Each projects will accomplish one or more of these objectives: (a) increase adult trout abundance, (b) reduce stream bank erosion and associated sedimentation downstream, (c) reconnect streams to their floodplains to reduce negative impacts from severe flooding, (d) increase natural reproduction of trout and other aquatic organisms, (e) increase habitat for invertebrates and non-game species, (f) improve connectivity of habitat along aquatic and riparian (terrestrial) corridors, (g) improve angler access and participation, and (h) protect productive trout waters from invasive species. Methods: Habitat enhancement methods typically include: (1) sloping stream banks back to both remove streamside sediments that have previously been transported from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain, (2) removing shallow rooted woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams, (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks, (4) installing overhead bank and other in-stream cover for trout, (5) utilizing soil erosion prevention measures, (6) seeding exposed banks and taking steps to firmly establish vegetation (including using native prairie grasses where appropriate and feasible), (7) improving angling accessibility, (8) fencing riparian corridors where appropriate to facilitate managed grazing and prevent damage from over-grazing, (9) restoring large cover logs to the channels of Northern forested streams to increase deep pool habitat, and (10) planting long lived trees along Northern forested streams to shade and cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs.These actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction. Additional benefits, typically extending many miles downstream from the project, include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality, and increased connectivity of aquatic and riparian habitat corridors.How priorities were set.MNTU focuses on those watersheds likely to continue to support viable, fishable populations of naturally reproducing trout and steelhead fifty years and more from now. Work is done only where degraded habitat is a limiting factor for a quality, sustainable fishery. Priority locations are determined using MNTU members’ extensive knowledge of the watersheds, MNDNR management plans and surveys, other habitat and conservation planning efforts, consultations with MNDNR professionals, and science based criteria. All things being equal, we consider the potential to draw new anglers outdoors, increase public awareness of the threats facing coldwater fisheries and watersheds, engage landowners and residents in conservation, foster partnerships, and increase public support for OHF projects.Urgent conservation opportunities.The targeted stream segments are no longer providing habitat or clean water benefits, angling opportunities, or other enticements which increase outdoor recreation and encourage public appreciation and stewardship of aquatic ecosystems. By creating productive fisheries in visible and accessible areas, these projects will increase citizens’ use of our coldwater ecosystems, tangibly re-connect Minnesotans to the land and water, foster understanding of threats to them, and motivate citizens to advocate for watershed and water quality improvements. Stakeholder support.We continue to receive strong support for these projects from landowners, rural communities (especially since most funding pays local contractors and suppliers for direct construction expenses), and local civic and sporting organizations.

Habitat enhancement methods:  Methods used on each project included one or more of the following techniques: (1) sloping back stream banks to both remove accumulated sediments eroded from uplands areas and better reconnect the stream to its floodplain; (2) removing undesirable woody vegetation (invasive box elder, buckthorn, etc.) from riparian corridors to enable removal of accumulated sediments, reduce competition with desirable plant and grass species, and allow beneficial energy inputs (sunlight) to reach the streams; (3) stabilizing eroding stream banks using vegetation and/or rock; (4) selectively installing overhead and other in-stream cover for trout; (5) installing soil erosion prevention measures; (6) mulching and seeding exposed stream banks (including with native prairie plant species where appropriate and feasible); (7) improving or maintaining stream access roads and stream crossings to reduce erosion; (8) fencing grassy riparian corridors, including in such a way as to facilitate managed grazing, in order to prevent damage from over grazing; (9) placing large logs in northern forested streams to restore cover logs removed a half century or more ago; and (10) in northern forested watersheds with little cold groundwater, planting desirable trees in riparian areas to provide shade for the stream channel, help cool the water, and provide a source of future cover logs. Agricultural area example:  Many streams in the agricultural areas of southern and central Minnesota have been negatively impacted by many decades of poor land management practices.  The projects in southeast Minnesota used the following approach to address this: Erosion has led to wider, shallower and warmer streams, as well as excessive stream side sediments which regularly erode, covering food production and trout reproduction areas.  In many cases shallow rooted invasive trees have taken over the riparian corridors, out competing native vegetation which better secures soils, and reducing energy inputs to the stream ecosystem.  To remedy this, a typical enhancement project will involve several steps.  First, invasive trees are removed from the riparian zone and steep, eroding banks are graded by machinery to remove excess sediments deposited here from upland areas.  Importantly, this reconnects the stream to its floodplain.  Since many of these agricultural watersheds still experience periodic severe flooding, select portions of the stream banks are then reinforced with indigenous rock.  In lower gradient watersheds, or watersheds where flows are more stable, little or no rock is used.  After enhancement work is completed the streams flow faster and become deeper, keeping them cooler and providing natural overhead cover through depth and the scouring of sediments deposited by decades of erosion. Second, overhead cover habitat is created.  Bank degradation and the removal of native prairie or hardwoods have dramatically decreased protective overhead cover in the riparian zone.  Two methods are used to remedy this situation:  increasing the stream’s depth, which alone provides natural cover to trout, and installing overhead cover structures in select stream banks.  Wooden structures or tree trunks are often installed into banks in hydraulically suitable locations and reinforced with rock as a way to restore or recreate the undercut banks which had existed before settlement and agricultural land use altered the more stable flows which had gradually created and maintained them.    Finally, vegetation is reestablished in the re-graded riparian corridor to further stabilize banks and act as buffer strips to improve water quality.  Depending upon the specific site conditions, landowner cooperation, and agricultural use, native grasses and forbes are planted along the stream corridors, although often mixed with fast sprouting annual grains to anchor soils the first year.  Unusual conditions in 2019 caused severe flooding in southeast MN which demonstrated that, due to the unique soils in southeast valley floors, more indigenous rock was needed on the toes of the stream banks on some projects.  These changes were made where needed, while staying within original budget.     Taken together, these actions directly enhance physical habitat, and typically increase overall trout abundance, population structure, the number of larger trout, and levels of successful natural reproduction.  In addition to the benefits to anglers of increased trout habitat and trout abundance, project benefits extending well downstream include reduced erosion and sedimentation, cooler water temperatures, improved water quality and numerous benefits to aquatic and terrestrial wildlife populations.   ",2013-07-01,2020-03-03,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,John,Lenczewski,"Minnesota Trout Unlimited","P O Box 845 ",Chanhassen,MN,55317,"(612) 670-1629",jlenczewski@comcast.net,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Carlton, Cook, Dakota, Fillmore, Lake, Olmsted, St. Louis, Winona","Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area, Northern Forest, Prairie Region, Southeast Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/minnesota-trout-unlimited-coldwater-fish-habitat-enhancement-restoration,,,,

",,"The Minnesota Moose Collaborative has implemented a variety of habitat enhancement treatments across the core of moose range in Northeast Minnesota on County, State, Federal, and Tribal lands since 2013.  Improving moose browse calls for treatments that regenerate preferred brush and tree species.  In some places this happens through natural or human disturbance.  Natural disturbances like wildfires provide excellent moose browse according to biologists.  Most logging on uplands results in some regeneration of moose browse.  However, there are tens of thousands of acres in moose range that will not see a natural browse regenerating event like fire or do not have enough volume of merchantable wood to make an economical timber sale.  In these areas the collaborative used bulldozers, brush saw crews, and prescribed fires to shear, cut, and burn the old decadent brush and stimulate re-growth that is more palatable, nutritious, and easy to reach for moose.   Cover for hiding from predators and protection from the elements is another part of the habitat equation.  Research has shown that moose prefer forests with mixed conifer and deciduous trees.  The pre-settlement forest in Northeast MN was 70% conifers and 30% deciduous trees.  Today that ratio is completely reversed with 70% deciduous and only 30% conifers. Improving cover habitat for moose means restoring conifers on the landscape.  The Minnesota Moose Habitat Collaborative has planted close to 3 million trees including white spruce, white pine, jack pine, and white cedar.  The pine and cedar must be protected from browsing by deer and hare using budcaps or tree shelters.  By the third year after planting, the seedlings need to be released from competition from surrounding trees and brush.  The collaborative accomplished this “release” with brush saws which both helps the trees get established and produces another flush of future moose browse. A look at plat books for counties in Northeast Minnesota quickly emphasizes the need for inter-agency partnerships to produce habitat results at a meaningful scale.  The ownership pattern looks like a patchwork quilt of County, Federal, and State lands (private as well but funds for this project are limited to public lands).   There is not an acre that gets worked on without some level of collaboration and cooperation between partner staff.  The first cut at site selection was made by looking at forest inventory data and local knowledge of potential project areas.  With time and experience, collaborative partners have refined the search for good moose habitat projects and added and dropped stands as field visits were conducted.   Proposals for specific work plans at each site are shared with wildlife biologists for their approval as beneficial to moose.  Partners decided who will manage the bidding and contracting, order necessary supplies, supervise the work, complete the documentation needed for invoicing, track the specifics of what was done at each site, and summarize accomplishments for grant reporting and other communication about the project as a whole.  As the grant recipient, MDHA is ultimately responsible for the finances and reporting to the Lessard Sams Outdoor Heritage Council.  But, the work it takes to produce results involves many of the partnering agencies.  The variety of combinations of roles and responsibilities between staff from MDHA, the Superior National Forest, Lake County Forestry, DNR, The Nature Conservancy, and the 1854 Treaty Authority that play out in completing the work is impressive.  For example, Lake County Forestry may identify a potential project on lands they manage,  a Forest Service biologist may review and approve it as a good moose project,  the 1854 Treaty Authority might collect pre-treatment data that is being used to track effectiveness,  The Nature Conservancy may order the trees and line up the planting crew, Lake County supervises the work, The Nature Conservancy again handles the documentation and site specific data and finally MDHA pays the contractor’s invoice and then requests reimbursement in the form of State managed grant funds. Field sampling and aerial surveys conducted by the 1854 Treaty Authority, U of M's Natural Resources Research Institute, the Fond Du Lac Band, and other agency and tribal biologists are showing that moose are preferentially using the sites that were treated through this project.

Over 290 letters were mailed to native prairie landowners informing them of their potential eligibility to participate in the Prairie Tax Exemption Program. Local Technical Teams (LTT's) have been forming in southern and western MN in an effort to coordinate implementation of the MN Prairie Plan (include SWCD, NRCS, USFWS, TNC, BWSR). SNA Prairie Specialists have been working with these LTT's to ensure landowners approached directly by these LTT's are made aware of their prairie stewardship options available through the SNA Program. In total, SNA field specialists have proactively engaged 76 different priority prairie landowners to discuss prairie protection and management options for their property, as well as provide native prairie stewardship information at 6 public events.",,"FINAL REPORT",2011-07-01,2014-06-30,"Environment & Natural Resources Trust Fund",Completed,,,Jason,Garms,"MN DNR","500 Lafayette Rd, Box 25","St Paul",MN,55155,"(651) 259-5130",jason.garms@state.mn.us,"Inventory, Land Acquisition, Monitoring, Planning, Restoration/Enhancement, Technical Assistance","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,Statewide,,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/native-prairie-stewardship-and-native-prairie-bank-acquisition,,,,

However, these plant communities have been declining in Minnesota for decades mostly as a result of development impacts. The Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources is using this appropriation to try to improve the quantity and quality of white cedar wetland plant communities in Minnesota. Efforts will include assessing existing white cedar communities to prioritize sites for restoration and then providing training and demonstration of restoration and re-vegetation techniques for local natural resource managers. OVERALL PROJECT OUTCOME AND RESULTS Project Background: Northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) has been declining in Minnesota for decades. White cedar provides ecologically diverse plant communities and critical wildlife habitat and wetland functions. Project Goals:Reverse decline of white cedar plant communities in Minnesota.Improve quantity and quality of white cedar plant communities.Methods: Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) established seven experimental white cedar restorations and reference sites in Beltrami, Koochiching, St. Louis, and Lake Counties. Experimental treatments were designed by Dr. Rod Chimner and evaluated use of cedar seedlings, transplants, seeding and natural regeneration. Protection from browsing by wildlife was by rigid tree protectors and wire mesh enclosures. (See attached technical Report). Results: Evaluation/Prioritization of White Cedar Restoration Sites: Goal: Evaluate 100 white cedar sites for restoration/preservation. Results: 132 sites were evaluated in Aitkin, Koochiching, Itasca, St. Louis, Lake, Cook and Beltrami Counties. Establishment of Demonstration Sites: Goal: 400 acres restored/preserved.

However, these plant communities have been declining in Minnesota for decades mostly as a result of development impacts. The Minnesota Board of Water and Soil Resources is using this appropriation to try to improve the quantity and quality of white cedar wetland plant communities in Minnesota. Efforts will include assessing existing white cedar communities to prioritize sites for restoration and then providing training and demonstration of restoration and re-vegetation techniques for local natural resource managers. OVERALL PROJECT OUTCOME AND RESULTS Project Background: Northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis) has been declining in Minnesota for decades. White cedar provides ecologically diverse plant communities and critical wildlife habitat and wetland functions. Project Goals:Reverse decline of white cedar plant communities in Minnesota.Improve quantity and quality of white cedar plant communities.Methods: Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR) established seven experimental white cedar restorations and reference sites in Beltrami, Koochiching, St. Louis, and Lake Counties. Experimental treatments were designed by Dr. Rod Chimner and evaluated use of cedar seedlings, transplants, seeding and natural regeneration. Protection from browsing by wildlife was by rigid tree protectors and wire mesh enclosures. (See attached technical Report). Results: Evaluation/Prioritization of White Cedar Restoration Sites: Goal: Evaluate 100 white cedar sites for restoration/preservation. Results: 132 sites were evaluated in Aitkin, Koochiching, Itasca, St. Louis, Lake, Cook and Beltrami Counties. Establishment of Demonstration Sites: Goal: 400 acres restored/preserved.

protect, restore and enhance 2,769 acres, primarily brushland, in northeastern Minnesota.  Habitat will be added to the WMA system and enhanced on existing public lands for species in greatest conservation need, outdoor recreation, and environmental benefits.","Problem and Scope:Until the 1880s, most of Minnesota was inhabited by sharp-tailed grouse where suitable open and brushland habitat, such as prairies, savannas, sedge meadows and open bogs, occurred.  This indigenous grouse was once one of Minnesota’s most abundant game birds, with over 100,000 harvested annually in the 1940’s.  Loss, degradation and fragmentation of open and brushland habitat within Minnesota due to natural succession and conversion to other land uses (cropland and tree plantations) has lead to a long term decline in this unique grouse’s population (estimated harvest of 16,800 in 2010), causing its listing as a species in greatest conservation need.  Today its remaining range in northern Minnesota, which is less than one-third of its historic range, is in jeopardy of additional fragmentation and degradation.      In east central Minnesota, research results have shown that genetic diversity of the sharp-tailed grouse population may be declining due to increasing isolation of subpopulations.  In nearby Wisconsin, genetic diversity has declined so greatly that Wisconsin DNR has translocated sharp-tailed grouse to create a genetic infusion to increase the likelihood of population persistence.  Increasing the amount of protected brushland habitat in northeastern Minnesota will be critical to the sustainability of the local sharp-tailed grouse population and gene exchange between Minnesota and Wisconsin populations.        Specific habitat that will be affected and how actions will directly restore, enhance, and/or protect them:Specific habitats to be affected will include up to 2,769 acres of openland, brushland, cropland and forest habitat.  Acquisition of the habitats and their transfer to MDNR for management as state WMA ,will protect them.  Natural habitats will include wet meadow, sedge meadow, shrub wetland, bog, grassland, and aspen and northern hardwoods forest.  They will be enhanced with prescribed burning, mowing, shearing, timber harvest, and possibly grazing, biomass harvest and occasional haying.  Other land includes hay, pasture and crop land that will be restored to open and brushland habitat through establishment of native vegetation, prescribed burning and natural succession. Multiple benefits: Multiple benefits of the above protection, enhancement and restoration actions will include increased plant and animal diversity, carbon sequestration, water retention and filtration, opportunities for biomass harvest, access to public lands for recreation, increases eco-tourism opportunities, economic benefits, and secure habitat for sharp-tailed grouse and other open and brushland species in greatest conservation need.  Wildlife species that will benefit: In addition to sharp-tailed grouse, several other species that use or depend upon open and brushland habitats are also in decline, listed as species in greatest conservation need, and will benefit from this project, including bobolinks, loggerhead shrikes, short-eared owls, yellow rails, eastern meadowlarks, American bittern, northern harrier, golden-winged warblers, Henslow’s sparrow, Le Conte’s sparrow, Nelson’s sharp-tailed sparrow, and American woodcock.  Six of these species are state listed as endangered, threatened or special concern.  Game species that will benefit include white-tailed deer, waterfowl (mallards, blue-winged teal, Canada geese, and more species during migration), wild turkey, American woodcock, common snipe, ruffed grouse, cottontail rabbit, snowshoe hare, fox, raccoon, and bobcat.  Many nongame species such as the Eastern bluebird, American kestrel, brown thrasher, gray catbird, common yellowthroat, sora rail, sedge wren, spring peeper and sandhill crane will benefit.     Urgency and opportunity:  If not acquired while the opportunities exist (i.e., willing sellers and funding opportunities), the chance to protect these priority tracts permanently from land practices incompatible as open and brushland wildlife habitat, and from fragmentation, parcelization and development may be lost.  Incompatible land uses, such as building sites, tree plantings, and uncontrolled natural succession, on a tract not only negatively impacts the tract directly, but also surrounding habitat by fragmenting the open character of the land and impacting area-sensitive wildlife species, such as sharp-tailed grouse that  are adapted to large open vistas.    How priorities were set / Parcel selection and scoring process:For consideration of protection and enhancement efforts by the partnership, open and brushland tracts must be located within or at the edge of an ECS landtype association identified as a priority open landscape through DNR’s SFRMP landscape planning process.  Further criteria to prioritize which tracts are most critical include a ranking system based upon county location, distance to active sharp-tailed grouse lek, tract size, and distance to protected brushland.  A sharp-tailed grouse habitat use model (attached) is being used to target brushland habitat for protection, restoration and enhancement.    Science-based strategic planning and evaluation: This proposal is based on science-based strategic planning and evaluation.   Biological planning, conservation design, delivery, monitoring and research, and adjustments in strategies as needed are used to maintain an adaptive approach. Sharp-tailed grouse leks (dancing grounds) are the essential hubs of subpopulations. Nesting and brooding rearing occur in suitable habitat within approximately a two-mile radius of leks.  All but one of the parcels proposed for protection have active leks either located on them or within ¾ mile away.  All tracts will be critical to sustaining nesting and brood rearing habitat for subpopulations of sharp-tailed grouse.  Research by Stanley Temple in Wisconsin suggests that suitable habitat patches of 4000 ha (roughly 10,000 acres, 15½ sq. miles, or a 2.2 mile radius circle) are needed for a sharp-tailed grouse population to survive.  A pilot study in Aitkin County was conducted in 2009 to examine habitat selection, nest success and survival of sharp-tailed grouse.  Data from this study and a two-year study currently underway will provide addition information for adaptive management. Annual spring surveys of sharp-tailed grouse leks allow for monitoring of local populations and the effect of habitat protection and enhancement and other land management activities on them.       Level of stakeholder opposition and involvement:No stakeholder opposition to proposed acquisitions has been encountered.  Proposals to protect land and manage them as public conservation lands are locally-driven by conservation groups, hunters, conservation agency staff, and willing sellers due to the multiple benefits such land protection and management can provide.  Local government has been or will be contacted and their support sought.",,2014-07-01,2019-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund","In Progress",,,Ward,Julien,"Minnesota Sharp-tailed Grouse Society","644 - 107th Lane NW ","Coon Rapids",MN,55448,"((763)754) 8361-",wjulien@peoplepc.com,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Aitkin, Carlton, Kanabec, Pine, St. Louis","Northern Forest",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/northeastern-minnesota-sharp-tailed-grouse-habitat-partnership,,,,

Only 5 percent of the original tallgrass prairie remains for preservation consideration throughout the entire historic tallgrass prairie range. Native prairie declines of 99.9% and 99.6% have occurred in Iowa and Minnesota, respectively. Grassland dependent bird species have shown steeper, more consistent, and geographically more widespread declines than any other group of North American birds. The number of acres purchased annually has been limited due to funding shortfalls since the establishment of this refuge. The current land acquisition budget cannot keep up with the landowner interest in this program. This funding allowed us to make significant progress towards the refuge's goal and objective of protecting this vanishing habitat. This appropriation allowed us to add 1,052 acres to the existing 5,331 acres in the refuge - a 19.7% increase. Our original proposal identified two key goals for this program: 1) Preserving and enhancing the remaining remnant tracts of northern tallgrass prairie, 2) Linking existing prairie tracts together into larger blocks to create more viable units and allow wildlife corridors. Working together, the US Fish and Wildlife Service and The Nature Conservancy achieved the following progress towards these goals: 1) 689 acres of remnant native prairie were protected, 2) 699 acres were acquired in areas identified as critical cores or corridors in the Minnesota Prairie Conservation Plan, 3) The acquired parcels added to existing complexes of permanently protected land averaging 3,800 acres. Two of the acquired parcels were more isolated, but both were located in areas identified by MN Biological Survey as having significant biodiversity and adjoining properties with additional native grassland. Beyond these accomplishments, this funding protected 119 additional acres of wetlands, 4,800' of streamfront, and 3,300' of lakeshore.

",,"Pelican Lake, located in eastern Wright County within ½ hour of the Twin Cities metro area is a shallow lake known statewide for its waterfowl production, migration, habitat, and hunting opportunities and is a state-designated wildlife lakes in Minnesota. This shallow lake basin has no natural watercourse inlets or outlets. Since the late 1950s and particularly, since the late 1970s, Pelican Lake has experienced a decline in water quality and a loss of the extent and quality of aquatic plant communities that once supported wetland wildlife habitat. This decline in water quality and loss of plant communities is associated with high lake levels and watershed land uses that increase water runoff. Agricultural land uses such as tiling and ditching within the Pelican Lake watershed have altered the natural hydrology and contributed to the decline in water quality. High water levels in Pelican Lake have contributed to persistent and increased rough and game fish populations, as well as a shift from rooted aquatic plants (macrophytes) to algae-dominated (plankton) communities. Increased turbidity due to re-suspension of bottom sediments and algae has resulted in the absence of rooted macrophytes from large areas of the lake.  These macrophytes, when present, moderate wave action, stabilize bottom sediments, uptake nutrients, and provide habitat for invertebrates. These factors have resulted in Pelican Lake changing over time from a “clear water state” to a “turbid state"" and caused negative effects on lake productivity for waterfowl and shorebirds that historically used Pelican Lake as a migration stopover destination. The loss of important food sources associated with diverse macrophyte and invertebrate communities was the primary factor associated with declining use of the lake by waterfowl and shorebirds. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) cooperated with Ducks Unlimited to install the significant infrastructure needed to enhance Pelican Lake through managed drawdowns. In 2012, Ducks Unlimited completed bioengineering designs and preliminary construction plans for the Pelican Lake project and oversaw all subsequent construction.  The project focused on the construction of a variable crest outlet weir and pump lift station which would allow for the gradual dewatering of the basin through an outlet (also developed as part of this project). The outlet was completed in 2014 and was followed by construction of a stoplog weir structure.  A pump station was constructed at the existing edge of the eastern-most bay of Pelican Lake. A 24-inch intake pipe was installed from this point for 900 feet into the lake The intake pipe involved placement of a structure within the lakebed to support the intake pipe at the proper elevation. The pump allows lower drawdowns than are possible with the weir structure alone.   The water level management that this project makes possible is guided by the Pelican Lake Management Plan (2012), which details habitat objectives for the lake and defines triggers that determine what and when management actions are taken.  Pelican Lake is currently in the middle of a multi-year drawdown. The DNR plans to develop a parking lot and lake access point in 2019 to give hunters and visitors better access to Pelican Lake.   ",2013-07-01,2018-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Ricky,Lien,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources","500 Lafayette Rd Box 20","St. Paul",MN,55155,"(651) 259-5227",ricky.lien@state.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,Wright,"Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/pelican-lake-enhancement,,,,

Island construction would restore wetland habitat and functions that have been lost in the 640-acre backwater due to erosion and degradation and enhance the surrounding area by reducing turbidity, preventing further erosion, and increasing habitat diversity. The project would protect areas of biodiversity significance and improve the Mississippi River wildlife corridor in the heart of the St. Paul metropolitan area.","Problem: Pigs Eye Lake is a large backwater of the Mississippi River, located in the southeast corner of St. Paul. The lake is shallow, open water, with a maximum depth of about 4 feet. The shallow depth and mucky lake bottom mean that the wind-generated waves cause a significant adverse effect on water quality and substrate stability. The waves also continuously erode the valuable vegetation on the edges of the lake, which has led to an estimated loss of 111 acres of wetland shoreline habitat since 1951. The conditions have created a negative feedback loop with no foreseeable improvements without intervention. Another 37.5 acres of biologically significant marsh and bottomland forest is at risk over the next 50 years, and new vegetation is unable to establish under the current conditions.Resource Significance: Despite the present poor conditions of Pigs Eye Lake, the area is a rare resource in this stretch of the Mississippi River where the floodplain is narrow and urban development is heavy. The shorelines and floodplain protected by this project have been identified by the Minnesota Biological Survey as areas of either outstanding or moderate biodiversity significance. The adjacent heron rookery is one of the largest in the state. Pigs Eye Lake is part of a network of aquatic corridors with connections to the Mississippi River, the Minnesota River, and Battle Creek. This project would restore, protect, and enhance these resources.Proposed Plan: The proposed plan is to construct a complex of 7 islands in Pigs Eye Lake. The features were designed to provide a variety of floodplain habitat types, blend in with the natural environment, and create barriers for wind, waves, and visual disturbances to visiting wildlife. Twenty acres of islands would be constructed and planted with a mix of native floodplain species. Shallow sandbar habitat is incorporated into the island perimeters. Three of the islands were specially-designed to establish 18 acres of wetland by creating enclosed, protected spaces in their interiors that would be planted with native wetland plants. The islands were strategically placed to serve as barriers to wind and protect the existing valuable shoreline habitat from further erosion. Outcomes for wildlife: The project would result in numerous habitat improvements, including: protected stopover areas for migrating ducks and waterfowl; preservation of the existing valuable shoreline; cover, spawning, and structural habitat for native fish; sandy areas for turtle nesting; shallow and more stable substrate to encourage macroinvertebrate colonization; water quality improvement due to reduced sediment re-suspension; and incorporation of depth and habitat diversity within the lake. Collaboration: The project has been extensively coordinated with natural resource agencies and other stakeholders, and has received widespread support. Stakeholder meetings were held throughout the planning process, and representatives from the Minnesota DNR, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Ramsey County participated in discussions to provide recommendations specific to habitat needs.

IBI scores indicate a dam, in place since 1970, is affecting these populations. The dam blocks them from migrating to essential habitats and has degraded spawning substrate. Results of 2012 MPCA sampling on the river indicate these populations may be absent upstream of the dam. This project will reverse the affects and support fishery goals. It will reopen fish passage to interdependent communities in feeder streams and shallow and deep water habitats. ","Two issues are at hand; one is the threat the rock dam structure has on the health and diversity of aquatic organisms and migratory fish in the Pine River, Big Pine Lake, and upstream waters; and second is the fragile condition of the dam structure. The proposed design solves both issues; reconnect up and downstream communities and remove the dam. A series of five rock riffle structures will be installed in 40 ft intervals along the stream channel at a slope and depth that will effectively restore connectivity and stability. The design is based off a natural channel design method pioneered by Dave Rosgen P.H., Ph.D. and successfully tested on 17 dam replacement projects by DNR Division of Ecological Resources Stream Habitat Program. Based on current research the effects of barriers on aquatic biodiversity and fish distributions up and downstream of dams are clear. A DNR study evaluating 32 barrier dams on mainstem or tributaries of Minnesota rivers showed on average, the number of species declined 41% (MNDNR Barrier Effects on Native Fishes of Minnesota. 2015). Furthermore, intolerant, stream-dependent, imperiled species were the most likely to be absent upstream of barriers. Findings of a 2012 Minnesota Pollution Control survey of the Pine indicated sensitive populations above the dam are declining. Although this reach passed the Fish Index of Biological Integrity, the score was low. Comparatively, the downstream reach scored good and supported a diverse fish community, including greater redhorse a sensitive species, and two rare species, the pugnose shiner a state threatened species, and the least darter, a species of special concern. Pugnose and least darter utilize habitat in slow moving streams and lakes. Habitat loss and degradation are the greatest threats to least darter populations (MNDNR). Big Pine Lake, located upstream of the rock dam is listed as a Biological Significant Lake for Outstanding Plant Community (MNDNR). Reconnecting this downstream stretch with upstream habitat in Big Pine Lake will open up spawning habitat for this species, as well as associated aquatic organisms and fish dependent on diverse aquatic plant communities. The dam is 48 years old and riddled with leaks despite regular maintenance. The design life of a typical dam is 50 years (Powers 2005). Dam failures are often precluded by seepages which increase and eventually cause the dam to fail. The effects would be devastating, drawing down over 400 acres of Big Pine Lake impacting acres of high quality vegetation and aquatic habitat. The low water levels would also affect fisheries, loon nesting, and recreational use of boats, canoes and kayaks. Construction of the five rock riffle structures will add 40,000 sq feet of key spawning habitat for walleye, smallmouth bass, shorthead, greater redhorse, and several minnow species plus restore access to upstream lake and stream habitats.

Impervious surfaces like roofs and roads not only increase the amount of runoff headed to the lake during every rainfall event, they also increase the rate at which that runoff reaches the lake. Some runoff is directly piped into the lake with no treatment. WCD and SWWD have developed a plan to address the phosphorus problem in the Powers Lake watershed. The first step was to complete a subwatershed retrofit assessment report for the watershed. The report identifies specific subwatersheds, or catchments, that rank highly in terms of potential for installing cost-effective stormwater management practices that reduce the phosphorus loading to Powers Lake.WCD and SWWD will now use CWF grant funding combined with local match funds to install stormwater treatment projects within two target catchments identified in the report.

Scope of work: With the requested funding, and with other funds leveraged by this money and brought by other partners, the following actions and outcomes were acheived. Phase 4 built upon the success of the MN Prairie Recovery Project Phases 1-3 by continuing and expanding enhancement work in 4 focal areas and protection in 5 areas. Project partners, primarily through our participation in Prairie Plan Local Technical teams, helped us to prioritize and refine guidelines for protection, enhancement and restoration activities within priority landscapes. The Prairie Recovery Program utilizes a collaborative model for conservation and we regularly consult and work with a variety of entities including state and federal agencies, other conservation nonprofits, agricultural producer groups and local governments. 1,707 acres of existing and restorable grassland, prairie pothole wetland complex, and savanna were permanently protected within prairie core and corridor areas as defined in the MN Prairie Conservation Plan. Lands are held by The Nature Conservancy, subject to a recorded notice of funding restrictions pursuant to LSOHC requirements. All lands acquired in fee are FULLY open to hunting and fishing per state of Minnesota regulations. Basic developments have been, and will continue to be, implemented (boundary signage, habitat improvement, wetland restoration). Protection efforts were coordinated with other partner protection programs (e.g., DNR Wildlife Management Area and Prairie Bank programs), via interactions through Local Technical Teams. An internal fund has been established by The Nature Conservancy to cover ongoing land-management costs and property tax obligations. Income generated by agricultural leases (grazing, haying, and/or cropping) are held in this account and help offset property taxes. 440 acres of cropland and former foodplots were restored to diverse, local-ecotype grassland or grassland/wetland complex. Contracting preference was given to local producers and contractors for provision of seed and establishment of prairies to promote creation of local conservation-oriented businesses. 37,567 acres of grassland complex were enhanced on public lands and those purchased with OHF funds and held by the Conservancy (“protected conservation lands”) to increase native species diversity and improve critical wildlife habitat. Management techniques included prescribed fire (75 projects totalling 27,997 acres), removal of woody vegetation (95 projects for 3,725 acres), control of exotic species (84 projects - 5,821 acres), and inter-seeding of degraded grasslands (4 projects - 24 acres). Much of this work was accomplished by private vendors through contracts. We also extensively used Conservation Corps of Minnesota (CCM) crews and seasonal staff employed directly by TNC. On-the-ground Conservancy staff provided by this grant were co-located in DNR or US Fish and Wildlife Service offices and helped form and lead local coordination and implementation teams; identified protection, restoration and enhancement needs and opportunities within the focus areas; worked with DNR and USFWS staff to delineate conservation projects on public lands; coordinated deployment of contract and staff resources to protected conservation lands; contacted and worked with private landowners to coordinate agricultural activities/leases on appropriate protected conservation lands (e.g., haying, grazing, cropping in advance of restoration); educated lessees on appropriate conservation grazing/haying practices; supervised management of lands acquired above; planned and conducted prescribed burns; and other activities related to prairie conservation in the focus areas.  Contracts were let to provide a high level of enhancement activities to new and existing protected conservation lands, greatly expanding current capacity. These activities greatly improved the habitat value of public lands that were not receiving adequate management treatment, while simultaneously providing local jobs through CCM and businesses. Activities included removal of undesirable woody vegetation, identification and treatment of invasive species infestations, removal of abandoned fences and/or other structures, and related restoration/enhancement activities. To ensure goals and outcomes are consistently achieved across all 4 project areas, the project coordinator oversaw implementation of the above activities and provided administrative support for budget monitoring and reporting. Significant marketing and media outreach was conducted by the Conservancy to highlight the goals and accomplishments of the project to local and statewide constituents, as well as elected officials. http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/minnesota/policy/minnesota-prairie-recovery-project.xml Temporary seasonal crews were employed by the Conservancy to provide additional capacity for public land management during critical periods like spring burn season. These crews helped create flexibility for enhancement projects and maximized the ability of specialized skilled personnel like burn bosses to increase the number of acres annually enhanced. 2. How priorities were set: Prioritization and prioritization criteria vary with the conservation tactic being employed (i.e., protection, restoration, enhancement). Focus areas were selected where there was overlap with MN County Biological Survey prairie “focus areas” and TNC portfolio areas. Each of the 4 project geographies directly correlate to core areas identified in the MN Prairie Conservation Plan. Because this project is a collaborative effort involving multiple partners, tactical priorities and criteria were established at both the state and local level by respective coordinating groups. criteria for each of these tactics include: a. Protection: location/proximity to other habitats, location/proximity to other protected lands, presence of rare/endangered species, imminence of conversion, ability to support grazing, size, cost, and likelihood for leveraged funding. A more robust listing of selection criteria can be provided upon request. b. Restoration: feasibility/likelihood of success, location, cost, availability of seed, and availability of restoration technical assistance, proximity to other habitats, and their ability to buffer or increase the conservation value of other protected lands. c. Enhancement: urgency/time since last enhancement, feasibility of success, accessibility, availability of enhancement technical assistance, cost, proximity to other habitats and partnership benefits. 3. Urgency and opportunity of this proposal: Only about 1% of Minnesota’s original native prairie still remains (about 235,000 acres of an original 1.8 million), and the remnants are still being destroyed and degraded. Less than half of those 235,000 acres are currently protected from conversion, and management capacity is unable to address needs on protected lands. Additionally, more than 90% of the original prairie pothole wetlands in the western part of the state have also been lost. These losses threaten the viability of Minnesota’s prairie/wetland wildlife and recreational opportunities that depend upon them. Further, huge strides that have been made in supplementing habitat with the Conservation Reserve Program are in imminent danger of being lost as contracts expire. Conservationists have a narrow window of opportunity to protect remaining native grasslands, wetlands and other habitats, restore and protect supplemental grasslands and wetlands, and accelerate enhancement efforts to ensure these habitats are providing optimal value to animals and people.  4. Stakeholder involvement: This Phase continues an initiative begun with OHF funding in 2010. We have worked very closely with conservation interests in developing and maintaining this initiative and will continue close collaboration among partners. Via past and ongoing projects, we are also coordinating with other stakeholders (e.g., cattlemen’s associations, Land Stewardship Project, county boards), and will continue to seek opportunities to expand that coordination.  Planning This project implements strategies identified in at least 6 plans, as identified below. 1. The 2010 MN Prairie Conservation Plan (Plan) identifies three distinct strategies and opportunities for targeting protection, restoration, and enhancement of Minnesota’s prairie and grassland systems. The plan recommends work in “Core Areas” defined as large landscapes that retain some features of functioning prairie systems. Using MN County Biological Survey data and USFWS Habitat Assessment, Populations and Evaluation Team (HAPET) 2. MN Statewide Conservation and Preservation Plan. The strategic framework of this plan has 5 elements in its “Habitat” section: integrated planning, critical land protection, land and water restoration and protection, (identification of) sustainable practices, and (provision of) economic incentives for sustainable practices. Further, while the plan does not go into great detail with respect to prairie conservation, it clearly states that “protection of priority land habitats” is a vital practice, and prairies clearly fall here.  The Plan identifies 36 distinct prairie core areas across the western third of the state. Collectively these core landscapes contain 71% of the state’s remaining native prairie. All 4 of the project focus areas directly correlate with one or more of these core areas. 3. Tomorrow’s Habitat for the Wild and Rare. The primary objective identified in the MN DNR’s plan is to “stabilize and increase populations of “species in greatest conservation need (SGCN)”. In the prairie regions of Minnesota, strategies to achieve this goal include: a. Support incentives that avoid conversion of grasslands into row crops where SGCN occur. b. Use mowing, cutting woody vegetation, prescribed fire, or careful use of herbicides to prevent the invasion of grasslands by trees and shrubs. c. Lengthen the cutting rotations for hay; avoid early-season mowing. d. Use light to moderate, rotational grazing programs to benefit SGCN e. Prevent fragmentation of grassland habitat. f. Avoid soil compaction in areas occupied by mammal SGCN. g. Increase native plant species components. h. Control spread of invasive species to adjacent native-dominated sites. This project proposes to address all but item “f” above. 4. The Nature Conservancy’s Northern Tallgrass Prairie Ecoregional Plan (1998). This plan identifies key conservation targets, geographic emphasis areas, threats to native plant and animal communities, and key strategies to mitigate these threats. The proposal is a solid step in the implementation of this plan. Also, as a step-down from the NTP Ecoregion Plan, the Chapter has completed local level planning (Conservation Action Planning) for smaller geographic units that correspond with the focus areas. Goals within these focus areas are very explicit in identifying conservation targets and actions and are consistent with the activities contained in this proposal. 5. DNR’s Pheasant Plan. This proposal is in full support of the Pheasant Plan goal to add 1.5 million acres of undisturbed grassland to the state by 2025. 6. DNR’s Waterfowl Plan. This proposal is in full support of the state Long-range Duck Recovery Plan to add 2 million acres of habitat to the state by 2025. It also utilizes establishment of complexes, as per the plan, to achieve multiple conservation synergies and benefits. This plan helps fulfill multiple priorities specified by the LSOHC “Prairie Section Vision”, including permanent protection of existing prairies and wetlands, restoration of prairie and wetland habitats, building grassland/wetland complexes in blocks sufficient to increase migratory breeding bird success, enhancement of public lands for game species and other species of conservation need, and protection of watersheds of shallow lakes. Specifically, this proposal addresses “Prairie Section Strategies” 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 directly.

Accomplishing this task requires rapid protection of our increasingly rare native prairie tracts, restoration of degraded sites, and long-term management of those sites. The Prairie Recovery Project will build on the success of previously funded Phases by continuing to Protect, Enhance and Restore native prairie habitats in select Prairie Core and Corridor geographies. Protect - An estimated 800 acres of prairie, wetlands, grasslands, and savanna will be permanently protected through fee-title acquisition from willing sellers in 5 prairie core/corridor landscapes as identified in the MN Prairie Conservation Plan. Acquired lands will be prioritized according to a matrix using criteria that include: amount of native prairie on the parcel, proximity to other permanently protected areas, quality of habitat and species diversity, and suitability for public recreation. Of these protected acres approximately 500 will be held by The Nature Conservancy subject to a recorded notice of funding restrictions pursuant to a grant agreement with MN DNR. The remaining approximate 300 acres will be transferred to the MN DNR as part of the Wildlife Management Area or Scientific Natural Area program. All lands will be open to public hunting and fishing as provided in the Constitution.Enhance - An estimated 6,000 acres of grassland/wetland complex will be enhanced on permanently protected lands, including lands purchased with OHF funds and held by the Conservancy, MN DNR Management Units, US Fish and Wildlife Service lands, and private lands subject to perpetual conservation easements. The primary objectives of our enhancement activities will be to increase native species diversity and improve critical wildlife habitat. A variety of practices and techniques will be implemented to accomplish our objectives including: prescribed fire; removal of trees and woody species; invasive species control including mechanical, biological, and chemical control; overseeding with native seed; and conservation grazing, mowing, or haying. The work will be conducted via contracts with private local vendors, Conservation Corps of Minnesota crews and Nature Conservancy seasonal and permanent staff. Prairie Recovery Biologists are stationed in the primary landscapes and are responsible for identifying and prioritizing projects in cooperation with our agency partners, selecting and overseeing private vendor work and leading and directing seasonal staff. The Biologists are also responsible for participating in and leading Local Technical Team efforts to increase efficiency and effectiveness of program delivery by multiple partners at the landscape scale. Finally, the Biologists provide a critical link with the local governments and communities in which they live and work. This local connection provides an opportunity for us to quickly respond to questions or concerns as a result of our activities.Restoration - Approximately 150 acres of cropland will be restored to diverse local-ecotype grassland and grassland/wetland complex (part of the above protected acres). Practices to be implemented includes those listed above in addition to re-seeding with native species and restoration of original wetland hydrology.Results to date - Through Phases 1-4 we have protected 2,750 acres of prairies, wetlands, and grasslands and have enhanced more than 27,000 acres of permanently protected grasslands. The protected acres span our priority geographies. In all cases parcels were purchased that were directly adjacent to, or contributed to, the functional integrity of existing habitat complexes. Average per acre costs for acquired properties have risen over the course of the program and has averaged around $1,550 per acre. Costs vary widely across the program area with land in southern and central Minnesota costing substantially more than in the Northwest. Our enhancement projects have focused on accelerating the implementation of prescribed fire, extensive woody vegetation removal, building the infrastructure for conservation grazing systems and mechanical and chemical treatment of invasive species.

",,"Activity 1 Complete design and all permit requirements for a ""sweeping"" electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1. The MN DNR believed that the best approach to keep Invasive Carp out of the upper Mississippi River watershed was to close the Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock. The lock is administered by the US Army Corps of Engineers and required an act of Congress to shut down. Minnesota senators and representatives successfully added an amendment to the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) that called for Upper St. Anthony Falls lock closure within one year of passage of the bill. The bill passed both chambers of the federal legislature and was signed into law by President Obama on June 10, 2014. Lock closure happened June 10, 2015.   Prior to lock closure, the MN DNR initiated an invasive carp deterrent project at Lock and Dam 1 based on the status of carp population at the time and the uncertain political will to close a federal lock.  The DNR contracted with Smith-Root Inc. to design an electrical barrier at Lock and Dam 1.  With the passage of the 2014 WRRDA bill, construction of a Lock and Dam 1 barrier was not necessary. But, due to the timing of passage of the bill, there was no cost savings by terminating the design contract for the electrical barrier. Also, by completing the design, the MN DNR has a better understanding of the costs, potential effectiveness, and safety concerns associated with this technology. The contractor submitted a final design to the DNR in 2014. Activity 2 Complete design, acquire permits, and construct deterrent barriers in Minnesota's portion of the Missouri River watershed. Waters in the southwest corner of Minnesota were vulnerable to Invasive Carp expansion from the Missouri River watershed. MN DNR fisheries identified locations to prevent Invasive carp from entering Minnesota waters and from entering the Mississippi River and Minnesota River tributaries through watershed breaches. • Okabena Creek - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR acquired a flowage easement and removed two road culverts. With these culverts removed, the township gravel road acts as a physical berm to separate the watersheds. • Okabena Creek Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier by removing two small culverts and installing a 12 foot by 6 foot electrified culvert. The barrier prevents upstream movement of fish. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Soil and Water Conservation District and a private landowner to build up an earthen dike berm to disconnect the watersheds. • Little Sioux River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: The DNR worked with the Jackson County Highway Department and the Minnesota Department of Transportation to install a grate system and tile line caps to prevent fish from moving across a watershed boundary via the tile line system. • Minnesota River - Des Moines River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Little Sioux River - Rock River Watershed Breach: An earthen plug was installed in a ditch and an outlet structure was modified to reestablish watershed disconnection. • Illinois Lake Protective Barrier: The DNR installed an electric barrier on a WMA downstream of the outlet of Illinois Lake. Activity 3 Develop cost share agreement with State of Iowa to construct barrier at Lower Gar Outlet. A joint powers agreement with Iowa DNR was executed to help share costs on a barrier to prevent Invasive Carp in the Missouri River watershed from entering Minnesota. An electric barrier at the outlet of Lower Gar Lake became fully operational in December 2012. Activity 4 Complete evaluation on feasibility of barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The Minnesota River is a free flowing system whose watershed covers much of southern Minnesota. The MN DNR contracted with the Water Resource Center at Minnesota State - Mankato on a project to evaluate several Minnesota River aspects including barrier feasibility.  Increasing the understanding of this system aided the DNR in evaluating deterrent barrier potential on the Minnesota River and its tributaries. Additionally, the project provided information on habitat suitability and described the Minnesota/Red River connection.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in July 2018. Activity 5 Implement and evaluate deterrent barriers at Lock and Dams. The susceptible portion of the St. Croix River is not conducive to electrical barriers due to the high level of recreational use (safety concerns) and the required cooperation from Wisconsin, which has expressed limited to no interest in constructing a barrier. The best alternative is exploring deterrent technologies in lock(s) below the confluence with the Mississippi River. The MN DNR contracted with the Minnesota Aquatic Invasive Species Research Center to evaluate the potential effectiveness of flow modifications and an existing acoustic deterrent in Mississippi River Lock and Dam 8 to prevent Invasive Carp movement.   A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in March 2019. Activity 6 Complete design, acquire permits and construct deterrent barriers in the Minnesota River watershed. The uncertainty associated with a barrier (effectiveness, timeline, cost, native community impacts, and ability to construct) on the Minnesota River was high.  This was substantiated by the evaluation completed by Minnesota State Mankato (Activity 4).  Given this scenario, DNR Fisheries identified high value aquatic resources that could be protected at locations in tributaries.  Construction of the two electric barriers, Madison/Eagle lakes protective barrier and Elysian/Buffalo lakes protective barrier, were completed in February 2019. Activity 7 Lock and Dam 5 Acoustic Deterrent Feasibility Study Mississippi River Lock and Dam 5 was identified as a potential location for installation of an acoustic barrier to deter upstream movement of Invasive Carp.  Before any potential construction project, the DNR required a feasibility study to estimate the effectiveness, construction costs, and annual operation/maintenance costs.  The MN DNR contracted with the University of Minnesota-Duluth to complete the study.  Study results suggest further development of the technology was needed before deployment at this site.  A final report was submitted to the MN DNR in December 2018.   ",2012-07-01,2019-11-04,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Nick,Frohnauer,DNR,"500 Lafayette Road","St. Paul",MN,55155,651-259-5670,nick.frohnauer@state.mn.us,"Grants/Contracts, Restoration/Enhancement","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Blue Earth, Cottonwood, Hennepin, Jackson, Waseca",,,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/protect-aquatic-habitat-asian-carp,,,,

To tackle the issues, Lake of the Woods Soil and Water Conservation District, with assistance from the North Central Joint Powers Board Engineers and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service and other partners, has been conducting an assessment of the watershed. Excessive erosion upstream along with peak flows resulting from increasingly altered land seemed to be the most apparent culprits.

This poses challenges to efforts to preserve these species because seed sources for these plants are therefore also becoming fewer. Using this appropriation the Martin County Soil and Water Conservation District aims to help reverse this trend. Through partnerships with local seed growers and nurseries they will collect, propagate, and plant these declining and at-risk, locally-adapted plant species on protected habitat as part of restoration efforts in order to encourage and increase their presence on the landscape. OVERALL PROJECT OUTCOME AND RESULTS The project focus was to accelerate the local ecotype seed availability of declining species for use on restoration projects. This project was undertaken in large part because 90 of the 238 species documented so far in Martin County by the Minnesota County Biological Survey of 2009 are considered to be at-risk. Native seeds were collected from 118 species off 33 different sites and we monitored additional prairie remnants. This project protected remaining native populations and expanded populations to new sites, enhancing environmental conditions and improving habitat diversity for wildlife. This project continuously proved to be a great educational opportunity. Each fall, area high school students were taught native plant species and assisted in native seed collection. High school athletic groups also volunteered with native seed collection. Over 250 people have been reached through one-on-one interactions. We have also heard repeatedly from these individuals that once they learn a little about native plant species, they continue to learn more independently and share the knowledge they have gained with others. We also educated landowners and students about identifying and distinguishing between native and invasive species. We have also gained a number of new volunteers.

This poses challenges to efforts to preserve these species because seed sources for these plants are therefore also becoming fewer. Using this appropriation the Martin County Soil and Water Conservation District aims to help reverse this trend. Through partnerships with local seed growers and nurseries they will collect, propagate, and plant these declining and at-risk, locally-adapted plant species on protected habitat as part of restoration efforts in order to encourage and increase their presence on the landscape. OVERALL PROJECT OUTCOME AND RESULTS The project focus was to accelerate the local ecotype seed availability of declining species for use on restoration projects. This project was undertaken in large part because 90 of the 238 species documented so far in Martin County by the Minnesota County Biological Survey of 2009 are considered to be at-risk. Native seeds were collected from 118 species off 33 different sites and we monitored additional prairie remnants. This project protected remaining native populations and expanded populations to new sites, enhancing environmental conditions and improving habitat diversity for wildlife. This project continuously proved to be a great educational opportunity. Each fall, area high school students were taught native plant species and assisted in native seed collection. High school athletic groups also volunteered with native seed collection. Over 250 people have been reached through one-on-one interactions. We have also heard repeatedly from these individuals that once they learn a little about native plant species, they continue to learn more independently and share the knowledge they have gained with others. We also educated landowners and students about identifying and distinguishing between native and invasive species. We have also gained a number of new volunteers. Native seeds were planted on 22 protected sites. Sites that had been previously planted were monitored. Photographs were taken to document both the native stands and progress on the planted areas.

In addition, Ducks Unlimited (DU) contract employees and staff provided by Minnesota Waterfowl Association (MWA) assisted in program delivery. Since the SWCD is responsible for the local delivery of the RIM Reserve program to private landowners on behalf of the State of Minnesota, they were ideally suited to work in concert with their local NRCS staff to efficiently and effectively deliver the RIM-WRP partnership. Once an easement is acquired NRCS is responsible for maintenance, inspection and monitoring during the life of their 30-year WRP easement. The state of Minnesota assumes sole responsibility via its RIM Reserve easement once the 30-year WRP easement has expired. BWSR partners with local SWCDs to carry-out oversight, monitoring and inspection of its conservation easements.Final Summary:In 2008 and 2009 RIM-WRP sign-ups occurred. 100's of applications were generated that far exceeded this appropriation.63 RIM-WRP easements were acquired on 7,276 acres. $6.3 million of RIM funds from OHF were paid directly to landowners which leveraged over $13 million of federal WRP funds. Approximately 2,423 acres of wetlands and 4,853 acres of adjacent uplands have been protected.The RIM-WRP Partnership successfully demonstrated that the State of Minnesota can cooperatively work with a federal partner (NRCS) and through a local delivery system (SWCD, NRCS, DU and MWA) to implement a permanent easement protection program that yielded thousands of acres of permanently protected wildlife habitat. This significant leverage was due to the amount of easement payments, conservation plan payments, and other costs the NRCS contributed to this partnership. The NRCS made the bulk of the easement payment portion through 30-year WRP Easement acquisition, while BWSR paid an additional portion for the Permanent RIM Easement.NRCS paid approximately 75% of the restoration costs for these easements, with RIM picking up the remaining 25%. The use of NRCS Practice Standards, along with BWSR's Native Vegetation Guidelines led to very high diversity mixes being seeded. The level of wetland restoration was dependent on restorable extent that would not impact lands outside the easement area. BWSR & NRCS evaluated restoration extent during our scoring review to ensure restoration was actually feasible, then followed up with site analysis and surveys.Several easements contained CRP contracts, where looming expiration meant a risk of losing habitat that was already in good condition. We estimate that 400 acres contained CRP contracts that were set to expire. Upon execution of the WRP Easement and RIM Easement, CRP contracts were required to be terminated.Unfortunately, $1,141,926 of the original allocation was returned and the narrative below will explain the challenges that caused this to occur. Challenges included:1. A misunderstanding occurred between BWSR and LSOHC staff related to the transferring of one OHF appropriation to a future year appropriation. BWSR was under the false assumption that at the time of the final encumbrance date of the ML 2009 appropriation that we could just roll the balance to the ML 2010 appropriation. Once it was discovered that this was not possible we were already past the encumbrance date for this appropriation and could not make any new encumbrances to utilize the balance of funds.2. The State of Minnesota converted from an old financial system (MAPS) to a new system (SWIFT) during the period that this appropriation was open. This conversion caused a mis-allocation of ML 2009 RIM-WRP funds to ML 2010 RIM-WRP. Once this issue was discovered it was again past the date to make encumbrance changes to the ML 2009 appropriation.3. After the encumbrance deadline for these funds had passed a few landowners canceled their RIM-WRP applications. We were unable to reallocate those funds to additional applications since the encumbrance deadline date had passed.As this was the first appropriation that BWSR received from the OHF many lessons have been learned.One lesson learned with this first year of OHF appropriations was that we had one easement that took an extra long amount of time to be acquired due to a number of title issues.

The easements limit future land use and put conservation plans in place for future management. The Minnesota Board of Soil and Water Resources is using this appropriation to accelerate the RIM Wetlands Reserve Program resulting in additional permanently protected wetlands and grasslands throughout the state. OVERALL PROJECT OUTCOME AND RESULTS The Reinvest in Minnesota (RIM) - Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) partnership is a local-state-federal partnership delivered locally by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR), and county Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs). The goal of the RIM-WRP partnership is to protect land with perpetual conservation easements and restore high quality wetlands and native grassland in order to maximize wetland functions and values and optimize wildlife habitat. For this particular project, ENTRF funds were used to secure permanent conservation easements via the RIM-WRP partnership as part of a larger effort to protect and restore the drained Crooked Lake basin in Douglas County, MN. The Crooked Lake Restoration project is a multi-partner project that aims to restore the drained shallow lake bed, which prior to its drainage in the early 1900s was home to diverse populations of aquatic invertebrates and provided thousands of acres of critical wildlife habitat. Project outcomes include reduced nutrient loading and sedimentation to nearby (impaired) Lake Osakis and improved water quality throughout the Sauk River watershed. The Crooked Lake restoration project was deemed a Federal priority in 2011 by USDA under the Mississippi River Basin Initiative (MRBI). Led by both the Douglas Soil and Water Conservation District (SWCD) and the Sauk River Watershed District and with the cooperation of USDA NRCS, BWSR, Ducks Unlimited, and many other local, state, and federal partners, the Crooked Lake Project evolved over the past decade. Primary goals to restore this shallow lake for wildlife and water quality purposes have been at the forefront. The proposed pool elevation (1334.0'), along with adjacent upland makes up the project boundary. Scoring criteria was developed that had the highest priority applications being those located within the pool and secondary priority was then directed at the associated adjacent land to the pool. ENTRF funds were used to protect 630.7 acres with perpetual conservation easements on which 586 acres of wetlands and 45 acres of associated upland/grassland will be restored, providing multiple ecological and wildlife benefits and assisting with local water quality goals. PROJECT RESULTS USE AND DISSEMINATION Public outreach for this project was conducted at the local level by Douglas SWCD, local NRCS staff, and other program partners. SWCD staff held public meetings to raise awareness of this project and to educate landowners about the public and ecological benefits of restoring the drained lake bed. SWCD staff also met with landowners in the project area one-on-one to discuss the options/benefits of enrolling in either the RIM-WRP or WREP conservation easement options available in the project area.

These lakes are designated ""Outstanding Resource Value Waters"" (Minn. R.7050.0250-0335) where herbicide use is prohibited. Treatment methods include mechanical removal along with burning and other methods. We propose to remove cattails using these methods followed by reestablishment of native vegetation to restore wetland communities. This will restore fish and wildlife habitat, reduce damage from detaching floating mats, and improve recreational opportunities.","Step 1 - Remove Non-native Cattail: In areas of dense invasion of floating mats, non-native hybrid cattails will be mechanically removed using plant mulching and harvesting barges. Cutting/harvesting barges are a quick and cost-effective method to completely remove aquatic vegetation where herbicide use is prohibited. Harvesting equipment cuts up and removes cattails, including the dense cattail mats that prevent other vegetation from growing. The equipment also collects the cattail biomass and stores it onboard until dumping in a designated location nearby. Any cattails not accessible by the harvesting equipment will be removed with hand tools designed for aquatic vegetation use. Burning will be used as a tool to reduce cattail biomass and stimulate native vegetation regrowth. We will conduct treatments over the course of multiple seasons to accommodate annual water level changes, weather delays, and availability of equipment. We are partnering/contracting with several tribal communities in Minnesota that have extensive experience in removal of cattails using harvesting equipment to restore wild rice communities and other native vegetation. Step 2 – Restore Native Species: Following removal of cattail, we will use a combination of methods to reestablish native vegetation. Simply removing the cattail mats, even ones in place for many decades, will allow dormant seeds, including wild rice and other native aquatic plants, to germinate without any further effort. While viable seed banks exist, park staff will transplant plants from nearby sites and directly-sow seeds to jump start the re-establishment of a diverse community of native species.The steps outlined above are part of our 10-year Wetland Restoration Plan initiated by Voyageurs National Park in 2016 to restore these non-native cattail invaded wetlands. Developing the most cost-effective techniques was the first phase of the project. Phase 2 can now be implemented by applying these techniques to the rest of the wetlands in the area. Outdoor Heritage Funds would be used to continue the most cost-effective cattail removal and wetland restoration techniques outlined in Steps 1-2.

Local partners are working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to mitigate habitat degradation caused by turbidity and excess sediment accumulating at the head of the lake. Project construction is anticipated to begin in 2020.","The Upper Mississippi River is impaired for turbidity (fine sediments) from the confluence with the Minnesota River to Lake Pepin. Continued deposition of these Minnesota sourced suspended solids has resulted in a lack of aquatic vegetation, poor invertebrate production, and reduced abundance of fish and wildlife. Deep protected aquatic areas that would serve as habitat for bluegill and other species, including walleye and sauger, is lacking in both the backwaters and within large open water areas of upper Lake Pepin.Working through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Beneficial Use of Dredge Material Program, the Corps will create/enhance islands and isolated wetlands, protect banks, and create deeper water in protected areas. The expected outcomes of these features include an increase in the habitat sustainability index for ducks by at least 0.25, an increase in the average annual habitat units by a net gain of 250, restored floodplain and wetland plant communities, enhanced public access, decreased suspended solid concentrations, and more natural sediment transport and deposition. Priorities for the upper end of Lake Pepin have been established as part of a collaborative effort among state and federal agencies in the 5-state region of the Upper Mississippi River. More localized habitat objectives correspond to the Pierce County Islands Wildlife Management Plan, approved by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Though the state line at the upper end of Lake Pepin is adjacent the Minnesota shoreline, and thus the initial project is located in Wisconsin, the benefits of productive fish and wildlife habitats accrue equally to citizens of both Minnesota and Wisconsin. The Minnesota DNR will remain highly involved in the planning and monitoring phases. We recognize that the threshold in which habitat restoration at the head of Lake Pepin becomes cost-prohibitive is fast approaching. The current fishery is still robust, but there are concerns productivity is decreasing as sediment and turbidity impacts have long-term effects. This project is expected to restore productivity to historic levels for the next 50 years.We realize the long-term sustainability of this project is dependent on continuing upstream sediment source reductions, however, not beginning the restoration of Lake Pepin will seriously impair Minnesotans’ ability to enjoy fishing, hunting, and boating in this singularly unique reach of the Mississippi River.

Over 293 acres of prairie, forest, wetland were restored and enhanced. Ultimately, the county was able to approach or exceed the goal of 20% increase in diversity across all three habitats based on plant surveys conducted. ","   ","This project focused on restoration and enhancement of native plant communities in Washington County’s last best public lands, as identified by the DNR’s County Biological Survey, the Metro Conservation Corridors program, and the County’s Top 10 Priority Conservation Areas (January 2012). The goal of the project was to establish a 20% increase in species diversity, resulting in higher quality and higher functioning habitats. This was accomplished utilizing a combination of contractors and internal staff to complete buckthorn removal and follow-up on re-sprouts, native plant seeding, controlled burns and reducing dominance of reed canary grass in wetlands to increase available wildlife habitat.  The restored and enhanced lands were selected strategically to connect existing managed native landscapes to previously isolated DNR identified rare and unique plant and animal communities. Ultimately, this has helped to create a mosaic of interconnected landscapes of sufficient size that will accommodate the greatest biological diversity. Overall, Washington County restored or enhanced 284 acres of habitat, a 8% increase (21 acres) over the original project goal of 259 acres. Restoration and enhancement activities took place at three locations: along the St. Croix River (St. Croix Bluffs Regional Park), within a major watershed of the Mississippi River (Cottage Grove Ravine Regional Park), and within a wetland dotted landscape that is characteristic of east-central Minnesota and the St. Paul Baldwin Plains and Moraines landscape subsection (Lake Elmo Park Reserve). Restoration focused on three habitat types: forest (154 acres), prairie (103 acres) and wetland (27 acres). Summary of the restoration/enhancement efforts and the evaluation efforts in each habitat type: Forest Oak forest habitat enhancement was completed in all three locations in Washington County, for a total of 154 acres, including oak forest, mesic hardwood forest and oak savanna where undesirable shrubs such as common buckthorn have been out competing the native plant communities. In these areas, a contractor removed buckthorn and honeysuckle using a combination of forestry mowing, chainsaw cutting and stump treatments and basal barking. Material was either mulched on-site or piled and burned. Following initial removal, buckthorn and honeysuckle re-sprouts were treated with foliar chemical spray for two years following initial removal.  In order to quantify the effectiveness of these approaches and the progress toward the goal of a 20% increase in species diversity, three plots were established at each location and surveyed each year from 2015 to 2018. The surveys showed that the work resulted in a significant decrease in buckthorn extent, height and density across all nine plots. As of 2018, Buckthorn extent was still below 25% in all but one plot, and below 10% in five plots. There was also an increase in native woody and herbaceous vegetation in all nine plots over the same time period. Native woody species increased from an average of 3.3 species/plot to 5.9 species/plot, and native herbaceous species increased from an average of 2.7 species/plot to 11.0 species/plot.   Prairie Stewardship work in the prairie included both 81 acres of enhancement and 25 acres of restoration at Lake Elmo Park Reserve. The tallgrass prairie enhancement was accomplished by interseeding native forbs into existing prairie restorations that were established in 1989. Prior to implementing, a pilot project was implemented to evaluate three different interseeding methods; the most successful method was determined to be a prairie burn, followed by discing and then broadcasting the forbs. A preliminary meandering survey of the prairie was used to identify species to interseed into the prairie and 51 forb species that were rare or absent were selected to be seeded in spring and winter of 2016. An average of 35% of the species seeded had established in a survey conducted in 2018, only 1-2 growing seasons post-interseeding. It is anticipated that more species will establish over time with continued management such as burning, grazing and or haying to reduce grass dominance. In addition to the enhancement, 25 acres of prairie were restored from cropland, 11 acres using OHF funds and an additional 14 acres leveraged by the County. The seed mix included a mesic prairie mix used for 18.5 acres and a wet prairie mix for 1.5 acres. In total 86 different species were seeded by Washington County staff in the fall of 2015 using a Truax seed drill for grasses and broadcasting forbs. In a survey three years after planting, 51% of the seeded species were identified (44 species, 10 grasses/sedges and 34 forbs). Similar to the prairie enhancement, it is expected that species will continue to establish and be identified with more time and management.  Wetland 27 acres of wetland, in 29 different wetlands, were enhanced at Lake Elmo Park Reserve, including seasonally flooded wetlands, mixed emergent marsh, wet meadow and littoral open water wetlands. A wetland management plan developed by Barr Engineering and Washington Conservation District detailed the control of reed canary grass as important to increasing wetland plant diversity. Enhancement methods included a combination of herbicide application and controlled burning, followed by seeding with a native wetland mix. Comparison of pre-enhancement and post-enhancement wetland surveys indicate an average reduction in Reed canary grass of 44%, as well as an increase in native dominant plant diversity in 22 of 29 wetlands surveyed (76%). Of the 43 species seeded by the contractors, 34 (79%) were identified in the 2018 post-enhancement survey. There are plans in place for continued follow-up on reed canary grass to ensure long-term persistence of the native plants.    ",2014-07-01,2019-11-01,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Dan,MacSwain,"Washington County","11660 Myeron Road North ",Stillwater,MN,55082,(651)430-4323,dan.macswain@co.washington.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,Washington,"Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/restoration-and-enhancement-washington-countys-public-lands,,,,

The creek has supported a wild brown trout population since they were introduced into Little Rock Lake in 1908. A population assessment done in 1992, however, failed to document the presence of brown trout suggesting that population may have become critically low during the drought years of the late 1980's and early 1990's. The stream has since been listed as impaired due to the low abundance of trout and other cold water fish. A subsequent study of Little Rock Creek identified low flows, specifically flow originating from groundwater, as the primary stressor to the fish. Little Rock Lake itself is severely degraded with toxic blue green algae levels during some years. In 2007, a severe algae bloom caused officials to advise lake users to avoid contact with the water. This Clean Water Fund grant will be used to hire local staff to work with residents to install measures that will help restore Little Rock Creek and Little Rock Lake. A major effort will include working with farmers who irrigate their crops. The employee will assist with assessing irrigation systems and irrigation management strategies so that water and nutrients are supplied to crops at an appropriate rate and time.

Acquiring the 257 acre parcel allowed the SRRWD to meet these goals by protecting such a large portion of undeveloped habitat and opening opportunities for the public by incorporating recreation, hunting, and fishing into the property. This project was time sensitive, as it was an essential step in securing access for the replacement of the Albert Lea Lake Dam. The Albert Lea Lake Dam and Fish Barrier Project was also funded by the LSOHC and was a 3-in-1 project designed to replace the failing dam and install a draw down structure that provided vegetation and game fish management, an electric fish barrier for protection from aquatic invasive species, and provided an aesthetically appealing rock arch dam. This project complements the 257 headwaters purchase as the water from the outlet of the dam continues to flow south through the middle of the property that was purchased. The 257 acre parcel has various natural amenities that includes the headwaters and 1.4 miles of the Shell Rock River, floodplain and mesic hardwood forests, undisturbed highly diversified wetland complexes and a riparian and stream bank corridor that is a mile long and approximately ½ mile wide. A majority of the site has undisturbed native plant communities, but some locations have been mined for sand and gravel, and roughly 43 acres of this property was used for row crops. After the purchase of the property the SRRWD, using the MnDNR recommendations, seeded the cropland into native grasses and wildflowers, and once the gravel lease is up, the MnDNR will incorporate that portion into wetland ponds. With the cropland and gravel pit restored, it creates a 257 parcel habitat niche in a predominantly agricultural setting that is at pre-settlement conditions. The Shell Rock River Water District was the fiscal agent that received the funds for purchase of this property. The process of this reimbursable grant was a relatively simple process that is well executed by LSOHC Staff and Council Members. The property is now in the process of being transferred into an AMA. This DNR management and appraisal process took longer than the District proposed because of the cumbersome DNR requirements. Once fully transferred, the DNR will have regulations for public use of this land as well as maintaining restored conditions.

Over the next three years 347,000 additional acres will expire - in geographical terms, 15 townships or 542.47 square miles. Minnesota was once a land of 18 million acres of prairie. Today less than two percent remains. The few acres of native remnant prairie that remain were once thought of as too rocky or wet for row crops but not anymore. If the current trajectory of grassland and prairie loss continues it will be devastating to grassland wildlife populations, including pollinator species. This proposal, working in partnership with Prairie Conservation Plan Local Technical Teams (LTTs), focuses on protecting current grasslands and buffering native prairie that are within wildlife habitat complexes not covered by other conservation programs. There are programs for native prairie such as NPB and NTGP NWR and programs for cropland, but there are no programs for ‘in between’ grasslands. As Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs) and LTTs review these areas for possible enrollment, they may find additional tracts that are native prairie. With this project, some native prairie may be included to square up parcels. In cases where larger tracts are identified, they will contact the DNR’s Biological Survey and Native Prairie Bank staff for a more formal botanical survey of the site.

The Roseau River Watershed District and Minnesota DNR, through multiple phases, will cooperatively restore a total of 13.6 miles of river channel, adding 366 acres of high-quality large river habitat within the Roseau River WMA and enhancing the river's riparian habitat corridor. This project is the first phase and will begin progress towards restoring the Roseau River.","The Roseau River is currently classified as Minnesota State Ditch 51 starting at the Canadian border and continuing 45 miles upstream to County Road 28. This reach of the river was channelized in the early 1900s causing habitat degradation of the river and its riparian corridor. The increased slope of the river has led to entrenchment, disconnected oxbows, high bank erosion, reduced access to floodplain and loss of critical habitat. Altered hydrology affects turbidity and water temperature leading to reduced biodiversity and vulnerability to climate change. The Roseau River Watershed District (RRWD) and Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) are leading implementation of a plan to restore this reach of the Roseau River. The project will restore degraded habitat, increase the resilience of the ecosystem surrounding the river, reestablish natural levels of connectivity between the river and its floodplain, strengthen biodiversity, and restore overall watershed hydrology to the area. When all phases are completed, the project reconnects 13.6 miles of the Roseau River for a total restoration of 22.5 miles of river, floodplain and associated riparian habitat located almost entirely within the Roseau River Wildlife Management Area (RRWMA). Estimated restoration length for Phase 1 is approximately 5 miles. Restoration will include rehabilitation of natural river habitat, and enhancement of wetland and prairie plant communities in both form and function. The river restoration will be based on the principles of natural channel design with an understanding of the hydrology and fluvial geomorphology at the site. The restored river and associated riparian wetlands and prairie will improve habitat for several species of greatest conservation need (SGCN) such as Black sandshell, Yellow rail and Nelson's sparrow, as well as game fish such as Lake sturgeon, walleye, Northern pike and Channel catfish. The restoration is located within the MN DNR's Aspen Parklands Conservation Focus Area (CFA) identified in the Minnesota Wildlife Action Plan 2015 ? 2025 (WAP) as well as the Kittson-Roseau Aspen Parkland Prairie Core Area identified in the Minnesota Prairie Conservation Plan. The Roseau River and its riparian corridor is considered a key habitat for SGCN and received a high score (high priority for restoration) in the Wildlife Action Network. Almost all of the land required for restoration is already part of the RRWMA, eliminating the need for major land acquisition and bypassing one of the most difficult steps in conservation projects. Outdoor recreation within the WMA already includes hunting, fishing and birding. The MN DNR constructed three large waterfowl pools located approximately 1 mile north of the project area. These pools are a rich source of wildlife habitat and are part of the Pine to Prairie Birding Trail. Outdoor recreation will benefit from the restoration by expanding opportunities to enjoy wildlife through improved kayaking and canoeing along the river as well as other activities compatible with the WMA's conservation mission.

Sediment delivered from bank erosion threatens fish and mussel reproduction. The Rum River is a state designated Outstanding Resource Value Water and Wild, Scenic and Recreational River with eighty actively failing riverbanks in Anoka County alone. Project partners will address these in a phased approach utilizing CWF, LSOHC, and CPL funds. LSOHC funds will be used for projects that primarily enhance habitat, including for species in greatest conservation need.","Eighty sites spanning seven miles of actively eroding riverbank were identified along the Rum River in Anoka County, an Outstanding Resource Value Water and Wild, Scenic and Recreational River. Identified bank failures contribute an estimated 7,838 tons of sediment to the river annually, which decimates littoral transitional habitat, smothers fish spawning areas, compromises mussel reproduction and vigor, and reduces success of predatory game fish species due to increased turbidity. The Anoka Conservation District (ACD), along with Anoka County and landowners, proposes to systematically stabilize and enhance these damaged riverbanks. In total this undertaking will require a projected $14 million in public and private funds, drawing upon several grant funding sources, and spanning multiple grant cycles. An inventory of active erosion sites was finalized in March of 2019 by ACD (https://www.anokaswcd.org/images/AnokaSWCD/Reports/Inventory/Rum_River_Erosion_Inventory_Final.pdf). Based on erosion severity, sites were assigned one of three stabilization approaches, which align with one of three state funding sources. Seventeen tall, severely eroding riverbanks require armament, have a primary benefit of water quality improvement, and will be addressed with CWF funding. Twenty-one shorter, moderately eroding riverbanks can be corrected utilizing bioengineering approaches, have a primary benefit of habitat enhancement, and will be addressed with LSOHC funds. Forty-two short, moderately eroding riverbanks can be corrected utilizing cedar tree revetments and will be addressed with CPL funds. This grant request is for ACD, in partnership with Anoka County, to enhance three to seven sites over three years that can be addressed using bioengineering approaches such as bendway weirs and root wads that produce in-stream habitat for fish, turtles and amphibians, native plantings and staking that produce riparian habitat above the water, and light toe armoring and minor grading that make these habitats traversable by wildlife. Sites will be prioritized considering linear feet of habitat enhanced, cost-benefit analysis, landowner buy-in, and accessibility. Phase-1 projects will enhance up to 2,250 feet of habitat, and reduce sediment loads to the Rum River by up to 630 tons/year. Riverbank stabilization design and installation processes can present hazards to some wildlife; namely nearshore mussels, amphibians and reptiles during construction, and reptiles and amphibians that are unable to safely traverse the post-construction stabilization materials and plantings. As part of this project, ACD intends work with experts in the field to conceptualize, design and implement approaches to best abate these hazards, with particular attention on species in greatest conservation need (SGCN) such as state-listed mussels and Blanding's turtles. The Rum River is identified as a key river stretch for habitat and species richness for SGCN through Anoka County. Large portions of critical streambank transitional habitat that these species depend on are gone already, with more lost each year. The number of optimal sites for habitat enhancing bioengineering approaches is limited, and will continue to diminish if left unchecked.

This unique and important habitat was at risk of development and was listed for sale until The Trust for Public Land (TPL) obtained an option to purchase the property. Protection of the La Salle Lake property was the number one priority for the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Northwest Region, and had strong support from multiple DNR divisions and interested stakeholders. La Salle Lake is one of the most pristine and deepest lakes in Minnesota. It is 221 acres in size, 213 feet deep, and lush with MCBS ranked ‘Outstanding Quality’ aquatic plant habitat. It is a quality fishery that regularly produces trophy walleye, as well as supporting healthy populations of northern pike, largemouth bass, black crappie, and bluegill sunfish. Prior to protection, however, there was no public access to the lake. The DNR and the County had unsuccessfully attempted to obtain public access to this fishery for a number of years. The property also contains over half a mile of La Salle Creek and key access to its upper stretches. The crystal clear creek originates in Itasca State Park approximately 8 miles to the southwest and meanders north along the narrow floor of a glacial tunnel valley with many seeps and springs, and eventually joins the Mississippi River on the property near a popular canoe landing. Portions of La Salle Creek are a designated trout stream because of high water quality, cold water temperatures, and ability to support coldwater fish species like trout. Little fisheries management work had been done here, however, because of limited access. This project improved public access to the creek and will allow a more intensively managed trout fishery. This land also provides excellent hunting opportunities. Eight and ten point bucks are regularly harvested on the property and ruffed grouse are abundant.

The project will benefit fish species such as walleye, smallmouth bass, and channel catfish. Rare mussel species (black sandshell and creek heelsplitter) not currently found in the reach above Melrose will also benefit. The upcoming replacement of an adjacent bridge creates a unique opportunity to complete this project.","The Stearns County Soil and Water Conservation District (Stearns SWCD) proposes to partner with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (MN DNR) and the City of Melrose to modify the Sauk River Dam at Melrose into a rapids to allow passage of fish and other aquatic life. An additional 500 feet of river downstream of the dam and 2 acres of floodplain would also be restored. The city of Melrose owns the dam, and is supportive of modifying the dam to improve the river through this reach, and has dedicated $500,000 to the project as cash match. Stearns SWCD provides local expertise in the implementation of restoration projects, and will serve as project manager. The City of Melrose, with SWCD oversight, will contract with a design consultant, hire a construction firm to complete the project, and oversee construction. MN DNR will assist with conceptual design, provide review of project plans to be completed by a consultant, and assist with construction oversight.The County Road 13 bridge adjacent to the current Sauk River Dam is scheduled to be removed in 2019. If the dam is removed during the same project time frame as the bridge reconstruction, it is estimated that $500,000 - $750,000 will be saved. In addition, the environmental impacts would be greatly reduced by having the disturbance in the river and adjacent floodplain from both projects occur simultaneously. The reach is presently modified by concrete walls and rip-rap. Restoring this reach of the Sauk River will create quality habitat locally, and access to over 16 miles of habitat upstream.MN DNR has been involved with numerous dam removal projects similar to this one. In place of the dam, a rapids will be built to gradually step the river bed down from the upstream reservoir pool to the riverbed downstream. Arches of boulders are integrated into the rapids to provide resting places for migrating fish, and to keep the highest flow velocity in the center of the rapids. Once constructed, there is generally little maintenance required. The City of Melrose has committed to providing any future maintenance that is needed once OH funding expires.Numerous fish species including walleye, smallmouth bass, and channel catfish will benefit from connectivity between the two stream reaches. Neither smallmouth bass nor channel catfish are currently found upstream of the Melrose Dam, despite suitable habitat. Walleye numbers are considerably lower upstream of the dam than in downstream reaches. Black sandshell and creek heelsplitter are mussel species that are currently found downstream of the dam but not in the reach upstream.

The land area draining to the lake is 762 acres, but a small a 28-acre residential neighborhood was found to disproportionately contribute 24 percent (roughly 14 lbs/yr) of the phosphorus, according to a 2010 study of phosphorus sources. The neighborhood was developed before Eagan established water quality requirements for stormwater retention ponds and the neighborhood drains runoff directly to the lake through a single pipe. The neighborhood has no available space for new retention ponds, but because soils are suitable for infiltration, plans focused on constructing small bioretention basins along street rights-of-way. Bioretention basins (also called raingardens) capture and rapidly absorb stormwater runoff from streets and driveways. Computer modeling estimates that 5,100 square feet of raingarden area along streets would reduce the flow of phosphorus into Schwanz Lake by 72 percent. The area was surveyed to identify optimum locations for raingardens and to determine whether adjacent residents would accept and maintain the raingardens once they were installed. During construction, soils are deeply loosened and special soils and plants are added to help absorb stormwater runoff. By the end of 2010, 4,580 square feet of raingarden area has been constructed. In 2011, an estimated 1,530 square feet of additional raingarden area will be constructed.

This is primarily caused by two human-induced factors: intensively drained and cultivated agricultural watersheds that contribute excessive water runoff and nutrient loading, and over-abundant invasive fish that have improved access via drainage networks and improved ability to over winter due to high, stable water levels and infrequent fish winterkill conditions. These factors combined with naturally fertile prairie soils result in turbid water conditions over prolonged periods which reduce aquatic plant and invertebrate abundance upon which wetland wildlife depend in our remaining prairie wetlands and shallow lakes. As a result, conservation agency wildlife managers are left with few options to improve and protect our remaining public water wetlands and shallow lakes. These tools primarily include acquiring and restoring land around our remaining wetlands and shallow lakes to buffer them from the effects of highly degraded and drained agricultural landscapes, and actively managing water levels in them to periodically induce temporary drought conditions to winterkill fish and rejuvenate the aquatic ecology of aquatic plants and invertebrates in them upon which waterfowl and other wetland-depending migratory birds rely. Through our Living Lakes Initiative, Ducks Unlimited (DU) strives to help Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service buffer and improve our remaining shallow lakes and large wetland marshes. This Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) grant funded program specifically funded DU efforts to help Minnesota DNR acquire and restore key tracts of land within approved state Wildlife Management Area (WMA) boundaries to help buffer our remaining wetlands and give DNR wildlife managers the legal riparian flowage rights they need to actively manage water levels, where needed. Through another OHF grant funded program for shallow lake and wetland enhancements, DU biologists and engineers design and construct water control structures and fish barriers that allow agency resource managers to improve water quality and habitat conditions for wildlife through temporary water level draw-downs. However, acquiring, restoring and protecting adjacent shorelands is important to compliment the long-term management of our remaining public water shallow lakes and wetlands. Protecting and restoring shoreland via fee-title acquisition permanently increases wildlife benefits for both upland and wetland wildlife, and also helps managers maintain improved shallow lake habitat conditions for longer periods of time. Permanent protection of shorelands along managed shallow lakes helps assure that these lakes will continue to provide excellent waterfowl and wildlife habitat into the future, and it also provides public access and gives Minnesota DNR a vested landownership stake to justify their management actions for the public good. Permanent shoreland protection also eliminates the chance of future subdivision and development, thereby reducing disturbance to wildlife and the real possibility that lake-use expectations of new shoreline owners will conflict with water level management strategies for wetland wildlife. This OHF grant funded program allowed DU to secure fee-title land acquisitions for the Minnesota DNR to restore shoreland wildlife habitat along shallow lakes and large wetlands, and help assure management of shallow lakes are marshes for waterfowl and other wetland-dependent wildlife in the future. The OHF grant reimbursed DU for fund fee-title purchase acquisition and related professional service costs such as appraisals and boundary survey, in addition to DU staff for time spent working with private landowners, conducting initial property inspections, performing due diligence, and grant administration. After pursuing several other tracts unsuccessfully in Murray County for Minnesota DNR where private landowners declined to sell, DU successfully acquired two tracts of land in Lincoln County and Freeborn County. DU purchased 40 acres from private landowner Remerowski adjacent to the outlet of Biggs Lake on the Shaokatan WMA in Lincoln County was purchased in fall 2011 and transferred to Minnesota DNR in late 2012. The acquisition of this shoreland represented the last private parcel needed by DNR to completely own and protect all the land around Biggs Lake, and outlet dam structure on Biggs Lake was subsequently replaced by DU with a variable-crest water control weir structure in fall 2012 via a 2012 OHF grant to DU. The land acquired was farmed in 2012 and 2013 to prepare it for prairie restoration, and will be seeded by Minnesota DNR in fall 2013 or spring 2014, depending on weather and timing of crop harvest. DU also used funds from this grant to purchase 23 acres on State Line Lake from private landowner Brackey, including the outlet of that shallow lake as well. The outlet is a very old, dysfunctional fixed-crest dam structure owned by Freeborn County, and will be removed and replaced with a variable-crest water control structure by DU through a 2012 OHF grant to DU in fall/winter 2013. The land, along with 22 acres purchased from Brackey in conjunction using 2010 OHF grant funds, is enrolled in the USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and was in native grasses, so no restoration was required although Minnesota DNR plans to conduct prescribed burning, forb interseeding, and possibly small wetland restoration in late 2013 and 2014. The land is being processed by the state for transfer to Minnesota DNR in late 2013 or spring 2014. Both Lincoln and Freeborn Counties were notified of these acquisitions by DU and Minnesota DNR, and both properties are open for public hunting and other compatible public outdoor recreational uses. Although the acquisition of 100 acres of land as originally envisioned for this 2009 OHF grant was not achieved due to rapidly rising crop and land prices, the successful acquisition of these two parcels totaling 63 acres on two key shallow lakes managed by Minnesota DNR represents important shoreland protection outcomes and allowed for the replacement of two old shallow lake dam structures with new variable crest water control structures that would not have otherwise been possible had DU not acquired these two critical tracts of land for Minnesota DNR.","Final Report",2009-07-01,2012-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Jon,Schneider,"Ducks Unlimited","311 East Lake Geneva Road",Alexandria,MN,56308,320-762-9916,jschneider@ducks.org,"Land Acquisition, Restoration/Enhancement","Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,"Freeborn, Lincoln","Prairie Region",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/shallow-lake-critical-shoreland,,,,

In the Prairie Section of Minnesota, 90% of our prairie wetlands have been drained and most native prairie uplands lost to agriculture. The wetland basins that remain are often large, deep wetlands and shallow lakes that now receive heavy runoff and drainage from the intensively cultivated landscape that surrounds them. Some of our remaining wetland and shallow lake basins are surrounded in whole or part by state Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) or federal Waterfowl Production Areas (WPA), while others exist in on private land nearby, sometimes in a partially-drained condition. Landscape drainage, intensive cultivation of the prairie landscape, and invasive fish such as carp has degraded these remaining wetlands and shallow lakes into turbid waters which provide only limited habitat benefit to migrating and brood-rearing waterfowl and other wetland-dependent wildlife, and poor outdoor recreational opportunities for Minnesota duck hunters. To remedy in-basin nutrient cycling that leads to turbidity and degraded waterfowl habitat conditions, DU partners with Minnesota DNR and U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service managers to enhance, restore, and actively manage shallow lakes and wetlands through temporary water level draw-downs to consolidate sediments and nutrients, reduce and remove invasive fish, improve water clarity, and enhance the aquatic ecology in some shallow lake and large wetland basins under their control. DU actively supports these efforts by providing bio-engineering technical assistance and delivering water control structures through other OHF appropriations. However, as agriculture intensifies and pressures to convert idle land into row-crop production and other purposes grow, restoring land around these public lands containing wetlands and shallow lakes is also desperately needed to help buffer them, restore their watersheds, improve prairie-wetland habitat complexes, and meet the goals of Minnesota's Prairie Conservation Plan. This program strives to buffer our remaining shallow lakes and wetlands on public land by acquiring and restoring lands immediately surrounding them. Some private land adjacent to our state WMAs containing remaining wetlands and shallow lakes include patches of native prairie or are restored cropland enrolled in the USDA’s short-term Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), but remain vulnerable to conversion back to agriculture due to rising row-crop and land prices, and need permanent protection. Other private lands are intensively cultivated right up to the edge of shallow lakes and wetlands, or to the edge of state WMAs containing such basins, and need to be restored and permanently protected. While some of these lands can be restored and protected thru the state or federal conservation easement programs, many other parcels come on the market for sale and must be acquired in fee-title in order to restore and protect them in perpetuity. This Phase 3 of Ducks Unlimited's facilitative public land acquisition and restoration program focused on acquiring and restoring land adjoining state WMAs with shallow lakes and wetlands. Acquisition of these lands are for state public land ownership and management to further buffer WMAs with wetland basins and to create or improve the size of wetland complexes, restore and preserve prairie uplands and small wetlands around shallow lakes and WMAs, and make new shallow lake enhancement and wetland restoration projects possible. Through this Phase 3 grant portion of our program, DU acquired (and restored where necessary) 11 parcels of land totaling 567 acres in seven different counties within the southern Prairie Section. These parcels included 135 acres of wetlands and 432 acres of upland habitat. This total of 567 acres acquired surpassed our projected goal for this grant of 400 acres, and thus this Phase 3 of our prairie land protection program was highly successful.

What were once vast prairies and wetlands is now predominantly an agricultural landscape. The SRRWD is requesting funds to complete the Phase VII Habitat Restoration Program. Our watershed prides itself in working alongside landowners to protect, enhance, and restore wildlife habitat. This project continues our effort to return agricultural landscapes to wetland complexes, enhance stream banks, and permanently protect biological functioning parcels. The results would benefit fish, waterfowl, and wildlife populations and reverse the trend of wetland loss and habitat degradation.","Program Goals:In 2014 the SRRWD created a phased, $20 million approach to restore, protect, and enhance degraded habitat conditions by implementing projects on a lake-shed basis. The Watershed Habitat Restoration Program is designed to accomplish the following objectives: •Remove rough fish species and restore desirable fish, waterfowl and wildlife populations•Enhance native aquatic rooted vegetation•Increase fish habitat and spawning areas and waterfowl nesting areas•Improve waterfowl breeding and migratory success•Restore stream banks and increase wildlife habitat and its natural prairie•Increase and improve community use of restored natural resources and protect the watershed from invasive species. Our program will also interconnect and reestablish important flyway habitats within Minnesota. Once completed, the program will establish waterfowl and fish populations, increase habitat for wetland dependent wildlife, and create the wildlife mecca that was recorded in the late 1800’s. Specifically, Phase VII of the program will contribute to these goals by:•Acquiring 37 acres of key targeted lands to reestablish native vegetation, protect land along the Shell Rock River, and improve nesting habitat and waterfowl food sources.•Restoring 60 acres of agricultural land into wetland basins to improve upland game and waterfowl nesting habitat.•Enhancing 15 acres of the Shell Rock River to improve instream habitat and vegetation management creating more productive, self-sustaining fisheries. The program includes projects that are prioritized on the significance of the benefits to aquatic habitat, urgency of the work, availability of leverage funds, location of projects and agreements with relevant planning documents. The SRRWD has a proven track record with the LSOHC and implementing projects that protect, restore and enhance natural resources. The SRRWD continues to receive strong support for these projects from landowners, local governments and sporting organizations. This proposal uses a programmatic approach to achieve prioritized habitat protection, restoration, and enhancement of lakes, wetlands and streams across the Watershed to once again create the wildlife mecca. Finally, this program will preserve an outdoor legacy for Minnesotans to use and enjoy for generations. Background:The Shell Rock River Watershed District (SRRWD) covers 246 square miles inside Freeborn County and includes a complex system of wetlands, streams, and shallow lakes that drain into the Shell Rock River. Managing habitat for this complex system is imperative to the SRRWD as well as understanding its role for providing critical habitat for fish, waterfowl and wildlife. Habitat degradation of wetlands, streams, and shallow lakes is an issue of statewide importance that requires accelerated investment in projects to reverse this degradation.

It is a complex system of shallow lakes, wetlands and streams. Among the District’s lakes are Fountain Lake and Albert Lea Lake, which are located in the heart of Freeborn County. These lakes are central to Albert Lea’s tourism economy and its identity.Degraded habitat of the shallow lakes, wetlands and streams is a conservation issue of statewide importance that requires accelerated investment in projects to restore, enhance and protect habitat for fish, waterfowl and wildlife populations. Protection and restoration of shallow lake habitat is the highest priority in the SRRWD. Reduction of habitat in the watershed is directly affected by surface water, artificial drainage, aquatic vegetation and populations of invasive fish species such as common carp. A decline in habitat is influencing available food sources for duck populations that include Northern Pintail, Redhead, Canvasback, Greater/Lesser Scaup and game fish populations that include Northern Pike, Bluegill, Yellow Perch and Walleye.Projects in the Watershed Habitat Restoration Program are designed to accomplish the following objectives: restore desirable fish, waterfowl and wildlife populations, enhance native aquatic rooted vegetation, increase fish habitat and spawning areas, waterfowl nesting areas, re-establish flyway habitat and increase wildlife habitat and its natural prairie, increase and improve community use of restored natural resources and protect the watershed from invasive species. This will be attained by:• Re-establishing 61 acres of wetland basins to increase food sources and improve waterfowl habitat.• 38 acres in land acquisition to re-establish native vegetation, improve nesting habitat and waterfowl food sources.• Variable crest dam structure installations will maintain and enhance game fish populations, improve waterfowl habitat and establish native vegetation to 620 acres.• Electric fish barrier and water level control station installation will re-establish native vegetation, improve nesting habitat, restore game fish populations and improve waterfowl habitat on 677 acres. • 3,778 acres of in-lake habitat structures to improve game fish habitat and food sources. • 184 acres of fish community reclamation to eliminate rough fish abundance and re-establish native aquatic vegetation. • 35 acres of vegetative restoration to improve habitat for wildlifeThis Program will utilize elements of successful local and previously funded LSOHC Programs throughout the state of Minnesota and implement them into a Watershed Habitat Restoration Program that will enhance, restore and protect fisheries, waterfowl and wildlife habitat within the SRRWD. Project scope in this Program consists of accelerated wildlife management areas, waterfowl production areas, Minnesota Prairie Recovery, living shallow lakes and wetland initiatives along with accelerated shallow lakes and wetland enhancements. In addition the scope of work will consist of rough fish management and game fish habitat improvement, enhancement and protection. Long-term goals are to restore, enhance and protect the lakes, wetlands and streams in the SRRWD. This will result in improving habitat and water quality of public waters within, as well as, outside of the Shell Rock River Watershed District – Cedar River, Upper Iowa River, Mississippi River and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico. These long term goals interconnect and re-establish important flyway habitats within Minnesota, such as: Mississippi, Le Sueur and La Qui Parle. The goal is to establish waterfowl and fish populations to create the wildlife mecca that was recorded in the late 1800’s (See attached article). Finally, this Program will preserve an outdoor legacy for Minnesotans to use and enjoy for generations.The SRRWD is in the midst of a watershed habitat transformation. The projects funded in this proposal complement and advance the habitat benefits of previously funded LSOHC projects including: Wedge Creek, White Lake and Fountain Lake Fish Barriers (2009-10); Shell Rock River Headwater’s Project (2011-12); Albert Lea Lake Dam and Fish Barrier (2013-14); and Goose Creek Fish Barrier (CPL Grant) (2013-2014). Methods and procedures utilized by the SRRWD on successful projects previously funded by the LSOHC will be implemented on 2015 funded projects. The District will leverage its experience to ensure optimum project design and implementation, resulting in rapid habitat restoration and enhancement benefits. In turn, implementation of these projects will provide long-term protection of the SRRWD’s shallow lakes, wetlands and streams. The SRRWD proposes to improve degraded habitat conditions through implementation of projects on a lake-shed basis. District staff and board members have demonstrated the ability and capacity to complete these projects with 2015 funding from the LSHOC. The projects are identified as a high priority in the SRRWD Management Plan, a plan developed with public participation, subject to public review and approval by the SRRWD Board. District staff focuses on identifying existing impairments through current conservation modeling and monitoring water quality within the SRRWD, which results in determining project locations with the greatest net return in habitat restoration. In 2004 the SRRWD released its first Watershed Management Plan to implement reasonable and necessary improvements to natural resources and water quality. Some of the major beneficial outcomes were: overall improved water quality, an aggressive Pollution Prevention Program that centered on repairing septic systems, and restoring a key headwaters lake. The District is now implementing its second ten-year Watershed Management Plan and welcomes the opportunity to build on the success of the first Watershed Management Plan and partner with the LSOHC to demonstrate the leveraged watershed based benefits that can accrue from a strategic approach to habitat restoration and protection efforts. This Program model can be replicated in similar watersheds throughout Minnesota. We have a proven track record with the LSOHC of implementing projects that protect, restore and enhance Minnesota’s natural resources. The Program is designed to shifts habitat capacity of the watershed to a recognizable level for generations to come and complements the habitat restoration and protection benefits from three previous LSOHC funding phases.",,2015-07-01,2020-06-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund","In Progress",,,Andy,Henschel,"Shell Rock River Watershed District","214 West Main Street ","Albert Lea",MN,56007,"(507) 377-5785",andy.henschel@co.freeborn.mn.us,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,Freeborn,"Prairie Region",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/shell-rock-river-watershed-habitat-restoration-program-phase-iv,,,,

Through one of the most ambitious Common Carp management efforts in the state, the program will improve fisheries and benefit waterfowl and non-game bird communities, improving recreation for fisherman, hunters and bird-watchers.","The Six Mile Creek-Halsted Bay (SMCHB) subwatershed is a 27 square mile geography in the western metro spanning Carver and Hennepin Counties. The subwatershed includes 14 deep and shallow lakes, totaling 2,488 acres, and over 2,900 acres of wetlands. Carver Park Reserve is situated entirely within this subwatershed, providing 5,700 acres of permanently protected open water, wetland, forest, and prairie habitat. Much of the subwatershed is designated as DNR Regionally Significant Ecological Area. The complex of deep and shallow lakes and wetlands are connected through a 12 mile stream system that drains to Halsted Bay, the most impaired water body on Lake Minnetonka - the most heavily used recreation lake in the State.Habitat for fish, birds and waterfowl has been degraded through much of this system, the results of overabundant common carp and historic agricultural land use, with users reporting decreased fishing success in Halsted Bay. Restoring this system is a priority for the District and its partners within the region (Cities of Victoria, St. Bonifacius, Minnetrista, and Waconia, Laketown Township, Carver and Hennepin Counties, and Three Rivers Park District). Together, this group is committed to aligning priorities and investments across agencies to accomplish large scale habitat, corridor, and water resource restoration objectives over the next 10-15 years.Habitat improvements throughout this system will principally involve restoration of lake and marsh habitats through management of common carp,and the restoration of wetland and contiguous uplands to enhance and connect natural resource corridors.The Common Carp management approach for SMCHB was developed based on a three-year, half-million dollar District investment with the University of Minnesota AIS Research Center from 2014-2017, which provided a cutting-edge scientific assessment of common carp populations, reproduction and migratory patterns in the geography. This assessment revealed some of the largest carp population densities ever observed by the center. Proposed Common Carp management includes:-Aerating 6 shallow marsh areas known to winterkill, to promote bluegill sunfish survivability and prevent carp recruitment.-Physical barriers at 4 locations to block carp from accessing spawning areas. The barrier between Mud and Halsted will also trap carp for removal.-Install a water control structure and barrier between two shallow lake systems to have the ability to block carp passage and manipulate water levels to eliminate carp recruitment and maintain healthy shallow lake systems.-Remove adult carp through winter or open water seining, box-net trapping, and removing carp in stream channels.This carp management approach will results in 2,488 acres of restored deep and shallow lakes, of which 66% is littoral habitat. Carp control will allow for the restoration of invertebrate and aquatic plant communities to the benefit of gamefish such as Bass, panfish and northern pike communities, as well as non-game fish and waterfowl, providing hunters and fisherman better opportunities to enjoy the region’s outdoor heritage.

This proposal combines invasive species treatments, increased use of fire in fire-dependent forests, and mast tree planting on sites being converted from ag land to forest as well as existing stands identified for harvest by the Subsection Forest Resource Management Plan (SFRMP) and the Sustainable Timber Analysis. This work supports goals identified in the SFRMP as well as the State Wildlife Action Plan and the MFRC Southeast Forest Landscape Plan.","Bluffland oak forests in SE Minnesota are changing to less desirable northern hardwood species. This change is due to several factors, including lack of regular fire in fire-dependent forests, which allows fire-intolerant species (maple/basswood) to dominate; and, the increasing threat of invasive species, which impacts natural regeneration and understory diversity. This change is compounded by the high percentage (65%) of oak stands that are beyond normal rotation age. Oaks and other mast-producing species are difficult to regenerate naturally, especially as they age because they don't resprout; thus, harvested older stands require underplanting to ensure oak dominated forests are regenerated. Many of our forests are succumbing to the impacts of invasive species such as buckthorn, honeysuckle, barberry and oriental bittersweet. These aggressive non-native plants impede natural regeneration as well as significantly limit the success of underplanting/direct seeding, and reduce overall forest diversity and quality. Because these species are more aggressive and bloom earlier than native species, they have a competitive edge over our native understory herbaceous plants, woody shrubs, small and large trees. If left unchecked/untreated, especially after a harvest, the invasive species outcompete native species, completely changing the type, quality and diversity of our forests. The ripple effect associated with invasive species includes a decrease in the forest's ability to support a larger diversity of wildlife. To counteract the impact of invasive species on forest regeneration and establishment, this proposal includes several invasive species management practices including direct treatment of invasive species (herbicide application), prescribed burning in fire-dependent forest communities, and stand improvement to reduce competition by northern hardwoods (maple/basswood). By combining a variety of management practices, we will be able to support a timber harvest program that results in a contribution to the wood fiber industry while also maintaining high quality, diverse, resilient forest habitat that supports a wide array of common and rare plant and animal species, and forest-related recreation. Stands that will receive treatment under this proposal will be selected from the annual stand exam lists identified by the Blufflands/Rochester Plateau Subsection Forest Resource Management Plan and Sustainable Timber Harvest Analysis. These stands are located on the Whitewater and Rochester Area Wildlife Management Areas, and Richard J. Dorer Memorial Hardwood State Forest.

",,"Enhanced 3,095 acres ",,40000,"NWTFMDHA ",888000,52000,,,DNR,"State Government","With these funds the DNR enhanced almost 3,100 acres on 140 different tracts within State Forests and Wildlife Management Area lands in southeastern Minnesota.  While a lot of forest management can be conducted with well-planned and carefully conducted timber harvests, these activities enhanced these forested habitats beyond standard harvest practices such as increasing hard mast production (acorns, hickory nuts, etc).  This will provide long-term benefits for a range of wildlife species and increased recreational opportunities for Minnesotans. ",,"With this appropriation, DNR Wildlife and Forestry staff used a range of forest enhancement techniques to increase the quality of habitat for a range of wildlife species.  These techniques and their objectives are listed below.   Invasive species removal – There are numerous invasive species in the southeast.  Buckthorn may be the species doing the most damage to these forests, but there are other shrubs, vines, and herbaceous plants that also affect forest productivity and diversity.  In many cases, this is done shortly after a tree harvest to try to catch invasives at the establishment phase instead of once they have become well-established.  Understory mowing – This is another type of invasive control used where the invasive species are so dense and the patches so large that chemical treatment or hand-work just isn’t reasonable.   Tree thinning – Tree thinning is the selective removal of less desirable species, either for timber production or wildlife benefits, that outcompete more desirable species.  With less competition, these more desirable species are able to grow and reach maturity much faster as well as produce more mast for food.  In some cases, certain trees can be girdled, killing them, but leave them standing.  These trees can provide cavities for wildlife.  However, this technique isn’t used near trails or roads where the tree which will eventually falls could damage property or injure people.   Tree release –  Often 'release' is a term used when enhancing mixed hardwood stands and thinning is more often used in areas heavily dominated by a single tree species.  The two are variations on a theme but with the same ultimate goal.  For instance, if an oak and boxelder or basswood are growing close together, a wildlife biologist might cut the boxelder or basswood and release the oak to grow faster and produce more acorns.   Seedling planting – With this method seedlings of the desired species are planted in an area.  By planting seedlings, the trees get a 1-2 year head start on overgrowing other competing vegetation.   Direct seeding – Direct seeding is used with mast species such as oaks where seeds are harvested and then directed spread onto the soil surface.  With this method, wildlife managers can do relatively larger acres than with seedling planting.  The determination of which of these two methods is most effective is made on a site by site basis.   Herbicide release – Herbicide release is often used to knock back herbaceous vegetation that can shade the soil surface and discourage seed germination or stump/root sprouting.

This includes over 7 miles of stream frontage. Three new Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) were created around the fee acquisitions, opening up 1,505 acres of habitat to public recreation. Restoration or enhancement work was completed on 225 acres of bluff prairies and forests, much of it on lands protected through this program. ",,"In it's proposal, this project identified three primary components: 1) fee title acquisition of priority parcels, 2) restoration and enhancement of prairie and forest habitat in important complexes of protected habitat, and 3) the strategic protection of high-quality habitat on private lands through the acquisition of conservation easements. Work done using this appropriation accomplished all three of those objectives. The Nature Conservancy used funds from this appropriation in acquiring 1,505 acres of land in fee from three landowners. These acquisition have all been transferred to the MN DNR Division of Fish and Wildlife, creating three new management units know as 7 Springs, Rush Creek Woods, and Choice Wildlife Management Area (WMA). This new public land protects over 7 miles of trout stream frontage, along with important forest and bluff prairie habitat. TNC worked closely with DNR Wildlife in prioritizing and acquiring all three of these units, and performing important restoration and enhancement work after acquisition. The size and cost of these acquisitions and the time frames provided by the sellers, it was necessary for the Conservancy to use $2,106,000 of private funds to complete the largest acquisition.  Restoration and enhancement through this appropriation focused primarily on projects on acquired tracts, where TNC restored 44 acres of forest and enhanced 100 acres of forest and 81 acres of prairie. TNC worked with DNR staff, Conservation Corps MN, and local contractors to remove encroaching brush from large bluff prairies and oak savanna on Choice and Rush Creek Woods WMAs. We also treated invasive species in fire-dependent oak woods surrounding prairie areas, allowing prescribed fire in the future to manage larger areas and maintain the diverse transition zone that includes prairie, savanna and oak forest. One burn has already occurred at Rush Creek Woods, and another is planned for Choice WMA this spring to follow up on these enhancement projects. Several floodplain crop fields included on Choice WMA were restored to mesic hardwood forests. These fields were planted through direct seeding in order to provide the best chance of having sufficient seedlings survive the expected impacts of deer browsing.  The Minnesota Land Trust (MLT) used funds from this appropriation to acquire conservation easements from three landowners, totaling 630 acres. These protected acres include dry bluff prairie, oak savanna and woodlands, and mesic hardwood forests. A mile and a half of undeveloped shoreline was also protected along designated trout streams and tributaries. One easement in particular, East Indian Creek, was the key final piece to solidifying a protected corridor running from McCarthy WMA all the way through to Whitewater WMA, linking together over 28,000 acres of protected land.  MLT strategically concentrated its land protection activities on high priority upland habitats, including bluff prairies, forests, savanna and high quality trout streams. MLT targeted private lands that helped fill gaps in the existing protected land framework, contained the highest-quality habitat, and provided the greatest leverage to the state. The Land Trust sought donated easement value in these areas whenever possible but purchased easements that help complete key complexes as necessary. This was the first grant in Southeast Minnesota where MLT transitioned to a competitive, market-based approach to identifying and securing conservation easements. This approach proved to be effective, leveraging $138,800, or 14% of MLT's total appropriation. Working closely with partners was key to the success of this program. Both TNC and MLT worked with other local stakeholders including Soil and Water Conservation Districts (SWCDs), DNR staff from multiple agencies, local contractors, and landowners in identifying opportunities, prioritizing projects, and completing them effectively. The collaboration built through this effort continues to benefit ongoing work funded through LSOHC and helps inform other conservation initiatives, such as local water planning and habitat monitoring carried out by other entities. TNC and MLT are committed to staying engaged in Southeast Minnesota and continuing the successful work of this partnership.

Two native prairie sites were added to Blanket Flower Prairie SNA in Clay County which now protects about 430 acres of habitat for 106 bird species including the greater prairie chicken: a 14-acre addition was acquired with this appropriation; and the 135.9-acre Ole Huseby Homestead addition to Blanket Flower Prairie SNA was acquired in part with this funding (pro-rated as 27.4 acres for this appropriation). A total of 563 acres at 27 SNAs across the state received restoration and enhancement work, plus development projects were completed at 17 SNAs, thus increasing the native habitat quality and public use of these SNAs. In summary: One 11-acre prairie reconstruction project was completed. Woody invasive/non-native species were removed on 202 acres at 11 SNAs and herbaceous or seedling invasive species were removed at another 44 acres at four SNAs. Prescribed burning was completed on 317 acres at nine SNAs. New Adaptive Management Plans were completed for two sites. Conservation Corps Minnesota (CCM) was involved in these projects at ten SNAs. Project Results Use and Dissemination Information about Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) sites, including those SNAs with new acquisition, restoration, enhancement and development activities through this appropriation, is available on the DNR website (www.mndnr.gov/snas). DNR-sponsored volunteer events are regularly posted at: www.dnr.state.mn.us/volunteering/sna/index.

Their business is directly affected by how much soil gets into the creek. Reducing dirt and sand entering Brown's Creek is also important to others. The creek is one of the few designated trout streams in the Twin Cities area that supports a fishable brown trout population. With a grant from the Clean Water Fund, Brown's Creek Watershed District is partnering with the Stillwater Country Club to green their grounds and address pollution runoff. The goal of the project is to improve the water quality of the creek while adding aesthetically appealing gardens and native plant diversity to the course. Work began September 1st, 2010 with the installation of a raingarden. 7 additional raingardens, 2 native planting areas and numerous other stormwater management features were completed by early November 2010. Raingardens will keep rainwater on the golf course helping reduce the amount of soil that erodes and enters Brown's Creek. These changes will keep 46.3 tons of sediment a year from washing off of the golf course and into Brown's Creek. That's 7 percent of all the sediment washing into the creek along its entire route, or the equivalent of four and a half dump trucks full of dirt.

The restoration of the downstream reach will result in more complex diverse habitat which will promote aquatic diversity. Future stream surveys will confirm improvements in species diversity and populations. The project will also provide enhanced recreational opportunities for paddlers which can be tracked through City campground use statistics..",,,,,2000000,,,,"City of Hallock","Local/Regional Government","The City of Hallock will restore and enhance habitat to facilitate fish passage by retrofitting the existing Hallock Dam on the South Branch of the Two Rivers and re-establishing a stable riffle-pool habitat downstream, as funding allows. The existing 11-foot high dam will be modified with a rock-arch rapids fishway that will provide lake sturgeon and walleye spawning habitat and reconnect more than 30 miles and in excess of 300 acres of high quality, diverse habitat along the South Branch. In addition to the fish habitat improvement, the project will provide enhanced recreational opportunities for paddlers along the river. ","Many native fish species migrate from the Red River to tributary streams, such as Two Rivers, to access quality spawning habitats. This is especially true for Lake Sturgeon, a native species recently re-introduced into the Red River Basin, which make very long migrations to reproduce in riffles and rapids found in high gradient areas. Barriers to fish passage, such as dams, prevent fish from making this seasonal spawning run. Much work has been done to eliminate these barriers but additional work is required. Restoring connections from the Red River to these critical habitats helps to re-establish and maintain healthy, robust native fish communities with greater resiliency to invasion by exotic species. Fisheries surveys on Two Rivers clearly identified the Hallock Dam as a barrier to upstream migration. Recent fish surveys conducted by the DNR have found that 13 of the 43 species present in the Two Rivers are absent upstream of the dam in Hallock. Absent are large river species such as Channel Catfish, Sauger, and Freshwater Drum. The absence of these fish species also impact mussel populations which rely on the upstream migrations of large river species to transport juvenile life stages to hospitable habitat. Based on several DNR studies, removal of barriers create more diverse mussel and fish communities and also expand and improve fishing opportunities in river segments above barriers.A fish passage project similar to the one proposed for Two Rivers was conducted on the Wild Rice River, another major tributary to the Red River. Similar to findings on Two Rivers, large river fish species such as Channel Catfish, Freshwater Drum, Goldeye, Sauger, and Smallmouth Bass were common below but rarely captured above the dam. Within one year of passage restoration at this dam, these large river species were common upstream of the dam, with channel catfish captured 70 river miles above the previous barrier. Restoration of fish passage on Two Rivers would likely yield similar results.Retrofit of the Hallock dam with a rock arch rapids fishway will allow fish migration upstream of the Dam into a 30 plus mile stretch of river and more than 300 acres of aquatic habitat between Hallock and the Lake Bronson Dam. The river channel upstream of the reservoir created by the Hallock Dam between Lake Bronson and Hallock is a segment of river that is in its most natural, unaltered state. The channel undergoes a series of riffles and pools, and provides excellent fish and wildlife habitat.Downstream of the dam, an unstable stream channel has caused degraded habitat and eroding banks. Here, as funding allows, the channel enhancement work will recreate the appropriate complex and diverse pool-riffle habitat. This will benefit both the project area and the habitat reaches downstream that will no longer need to handle the excessive sediment load.

Purchase of these easements leveraged $679,500 through a grant from the Doris Duke Foundation through the Conservation Fund, a CPL grant to Washington County, donated easement value by a landowner, and funding from the Belwin Conservancy. In addition, the Minnesota Land Trust provided $24,300 in funding to cover the long term stewardship and enforcement costs on the Daley parcel and personnel costs attributed to the projects.

This parcel provides for public angling access and includes grasslands, mixed hardwood forest, floodplain forest, wetlands and 741 linear feet of shoreline. No OHF funds were used for this fee title acquisition. Restoration and Enhancement of In-Stream and Upland Habitat: Belwin Conservancy completed restoration on 124 acres of prairie and upland habitat owned by Belwin. In-stream habitat was not completed due to Trout Unlimited requirement of public angling access. Public angling access was accomplished through this grant on a parcel that did not require in-stream enhancements.",,"The Valley Creek watershed, located on the eastern edge of the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area and a direct tributary to the St. Croix River, is one of the most biologically significant areas within the Metro region. Valley Creek is one of Minnesota's best trout-producing streams. It is one of only a few with a naturally reproducing brook trout population (Minnesota's only native trout species), and sustains large populations of brown and rainbow trout as well.  While many of the trout streams in Minnesota depend on stocking to maintain their trout populations, Valley Creek’s habitat is of sufficiently high quality for natural reproduction to occur.  The Valley Creek watershed is home to more than 20 endangered, threatened, and special concern species, including the American brook lamprey, the hooded warbler, and Blanding’s turtle. Protection of this critical natural resource in the ever-growing Metro region is the focus of the Valley Creek Protection Partnership.The proposed outcomes of the Valley Creek Protection Partnership were to permanently protect (through conservation easement and fee title acquisition), restore and enhance priority lands (oak savanna, coldwater fisheries and a viable habitat corridor within the watershed of Valley Creek) through: •    Protection via easement and fee title 80 acres of upland habitat and 1 mile of trout stream;•    Restoration of 30 acres of oak savanna and upland habitats; and •    Enhancement of 0.75 miles of trout streamProcesses and methods to achieve these outcomes are detailed below:1. Protection through Conservation Easement: The Minnesota Land Trust and Washington County jointly targeted three parcels for protection via conservation easement. Ultimately two conservation easements were acquired on important properties over the course of the grant. One potential project failed to materialize. Acquisition of easements were realized through intensive one-on-one negotiations with landowners over 2-3 years. Although landowner motivations for pursuing conservation easements varied, a donated value of nearly $270,000 was realized from the landowners. Both landowners required some level of compensation for loss of development rights. The two properties include:•    Vallley Creek (Daley): A conservation easement now protects a 49-acre property of very high natural resource value, with 2,081 linear feet of Valley Creek shoreline. The easement is co-held by the Belwin Conservancy.•    Valley Creek (T & C Johnson): A conservation easement now protects 17 acres of wetlands, forests, grasslands and 741 feet of shoreline along Valley Creek. The land protected through conservation easements will be sustained through the best standards and practices for conservation easement stewardship. The Minnesota Land Trust has a stewardship program that includes annual property monitoring, effective records management, addressing inquiries and interpretations, tracking changes in ownership, investigating potential violations and defending the easement in the rare case of a violation. The 2 conservation easements have been monitored by the Minnesota Land Trust each year since purchase. There have been no reported violations. Monitoring and defense of the conservation easement terms will continue in perpetuity.2. Protection through Fee Title Acquisition: Belwin Conservancy purchased the fee interest in 17 acres that included 741 linear feet of Valley Creek. No funds from the Outdoor Heritage Fund were used to purchase this property through fee title. This parcel provides for public angling access. Because public angling access to Valley Creek in Afton and West Lakeland Township was vocally opposed, Belwin Conservancy convened a working group composed of local residents some of whom were amateur fly fishing people, and worked through access, parking, hours, and an educational program that would highlight stream ecology, fish populations and stream stewardship. This was a pilot program in 2016 and will be evaluated at the end of the season with feedback being used to design the 2017 program. A limited access public angling access is what the community is willing to support at this time. 3. Restoration and Enhancement of In-Stream and Upland Habitat: Belwin Conservancy staff and contractors including Conservation Minnesota, Prairie Restorations, Inc. and ForeControl performed restoration work on 46.07 acres of prairie and 78.21 acres of habitat. The work involved: hand cutting buckthorn, hand pulling grecian foxglove, garlic mustard, dames rocket, removal of undesirable sapling and canopy trees, promoting regrowth of understory vegetation by selective chemical control of invasives, subsequent multi-year chemical spraying. As much of the topography is steep slope or wetland complexes, the majority of the work was done by hand. Continued follow-up invasive control is necessary for a 10-year period after restoration, and then continued monitoring and ad hoc control measures to ensure the on-going health of the restoration project. Please note: LSOHC reporting requires that the majority activity be listed (e.g. protection through conservation easement) even if that property is also the recipient of restoration $. In this report, the reader may note differences in acreage and funding attributed to those parcels that were primary restoration parcels as the reporting format did not allow us to attribute restoration $ to the Daley project - though restoration $ were spent on that project. Instead, we allocated the restoration $ from the Daley project to the 3 other restoration parcels. In-stream restoration work did not take place because the Partnership was unable to obtain consent of the landowner for public angling access on the parcel where in-stream enhancements were needed.

We will also continue to develop regional curves to speed up and validate stream analyses and to help design stream restoration projects.","Contributed stream geomorphology and connectivity information primarily for watersheds where the MPCA and local partners were developing or updating WRAPS: Conducted at least 41 stream surveys in 15 watersheds and started making the data available in a statewide web map and in story maps such as this one. Collected culvert inventory data in three (3) watersheds to be added to a statewide GIS layer. Completed at least 21 and worked on at least 16 more stream geomorphology analyses or reports in 20 watersheds. Seven (7) of these analyses are intensive subwatershed studies that distinguish stream sources from other sources of sediment in impaired streams to help partners identify catchments where upland restoration efforts stream restoration efforts or a combination will be most effective. Collaborated with MPCA and local partners on the above. MPCA and partners use the information to better understand biological and water quality impairments improve pollutant load calculations and help identify enduring multiple-benefit solutions that address root causes and promote watershed health and resilience. Completed a major project to standardize streamline and enhance DNR hydrology and stream geomorphology contributions: Finished developing a consistent repeatable method of evaluation to quantify the degree of hydrologic change in a watershed and related impacts to flooding channel-forming flows and biological community health. Staff piloted the evaluation in six (6) major watersheds. In five (5) other major watersheds staff applied a new consistent and repeatable process developed in FY19 to identify subwatersheds where an intensive study of stream stability and sediment supply would be most fruitful for discussion with local partners.

The model gives a detailed summary of water balance with and without a pattern tile drainage system for both corn and soybean rotations helping evaluate BMP effectiveness and interpret monitoring data in a pattern tiled field. The DNR’s mining hydrologists worked with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to enhance their HSPF (Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran) model for the St. Louis River watershed by: 1) improving the mining discharge information in the model and; 2) developing user input files that incorporate “chemical tracers” to mine waters so that impacts from mining and other activities can be evaluated more quickly and accurately.

Significant effort was also invested in FY14 to improve how climate and rainfall data are incorporated into our models. Climatic parameters are key drivers of how water (and pollutants) moves across and through landscapes. Accurately incorporating this information is critical if our modeling efforts are going to simulate physical processes in the landscape and provide reliable decision-support guidance.

This project benefits animal species including the pileated woodpecker and the threatened Blanding’s turtle. Primary outcomes include better quality plant communities, reduced fragmentation, and higher functioning wetlands. ",,"Theodore Wirth Regional Park was established more than 100 years ago to protect natural resources. Wirth's total 750 acres consist of wetland, woodland, savanna, shoreline and lake habitats. These habitats provide for a variety of wildlife including mammals, reptiles, amphibians, pollinating insects, fish, and migratory birds within a fully developed urban metro area.  The Eloise Butler Wildflower Garden and Bird Sanctuary, established in 1907 as a public wildflower garden to view Minnesota native plants and as a sanctuary for birds, is found in the southern portion of the park. A  tamarack bog, a wetland plant community that is rare for the southern part of the State, is also found in the southern portion of the park within the project area. The tamarack bog and the Eloise Butler Wildflower Garden and Bird Sanctuary provide unique outdoor experiences for urban dwellers. Migratory birds use Wirth Park as a stopover on their migratory route the Mississippi flyway, just three miles to the east. Recently Wirth Park and Minneapolis Chain of Lakes Regional Park were designated an Important Bird Area by Audubon International for this reason.  When Wirth Park was established more than 100 years ago the land was not impacted by non-native invasive plants. Times have changed and Wirth park's oak forest is dominated by common buckthorn. Wetland areas as well have dense stands of both common and glossy buckthorn. Activities funded by the Outdoor Heritage Fund (OHF) included removal and control of invasive species in forest and wetland habitats and enhancement plantings with native plant species.  Since 2005, Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board's (MPRB) Citizen Advisory Committees have consistently listed natural resource enhancements as top priorities for Wirth park and are a key component of the Wirth Park Master Plan.  Contracted work for the grant occurred from 2015-2016 and included saw cutting and forestry mowing of woody invasive species. Control of buckthorn in the oak forest and wetland areas consisted of cutting down large mature buckthorn with a chain or brush saw and treating the stump with herbicide. Due to the density of mature buckthorn in certain areas, the resulting brush resulted in large quantities of cut brush littering the landscape, making these areas impossible to access.  In these situations the brush was chipped and left in place. Brush chipping allows for better access into the area for future control of invasive species and enhancement plantings.   In forested areas where there was low density of large mature buckthorn, forestry mowing was done through contracted services with a forestry brush mower.  Where there were steeper slopes that a forestry mower couldn't safely operate, a brush saw was used. In 2017, the MPRB  tried for the first time goat browsing to control invasive species through contracted services. The goat browsing occurred for three consecutive years (2017-2019) with one annual browsing occurring during the summer (June or July) in two locations in the oak forest.  Forestry mowing, brush sawing and goat browsing all served to control the seeding of woody invasive species. Oriental bittersweet has become an increasingly prevalent non-native invasive species in many park areas.  Oriental bittersweet was first found in Wirth Park by MPRB staff in 2013 and has been reported to the Minnesota Department of Agriculture through eddmaps.org.  It is found in the OHF project area and was part of invasive species control for this project. Control of mature Oriental bittersweet stems, where vines were entangled in the tree canopy, consisted of cutting the stem and treating the stump with an herbicide. Monitoring of the area occurred and any seedlings that sprouted were treated with herbicide to prevent maturation. The wetland areas to the south of Glenwood Avenue are a unique natural resource that are part of a groundwater system which once provided water for the Glenwood Inglewood spring water plant.  There is open water and seepage in this area throughout the  seasons, making work in this area difficult.  Common and glossy buckthorn are prevalent invasive species in this area as well as purple loosestrife. Purple loosestrife control through biological controls has been in place in Wirth park since the 1990s and is working well to control the plant in both the Glenwood wetlands and the wetland edges of Birch pond. Buckthorn removal occurred in the Glenwood wetlands during the winter and early spring months when the ground was more frozen. Buckthorn in these areas was hand cut and treated with an aquatic approved herbicide.  As much brush as possible was chipped and left onsite. Record snowfalls during the winter of 2018-19 and record rainfall in 2019 made this area very difficult to work in. The OHF project received assistance from the Conservation Corps Youth Outdoors (CCMI YO) program. CCMI YO adult and youth crews worked on invasive species control and planting enhancements from 2017 until the close of the grant in June 2019.  Adult crews hand cut mature buckthorn from woodland and wetland areas. The youth program participants helped by hand pulling invasive species and piling brush for later chipping.  Youth program participants also seeded in prairie grasses into areas that will be maintained as oak savanna.   ",2014-07-01,2020-01-30,"Outdoor Heritage Fund",Completed,,,Cliff,"Swenson, PLA","Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Board","2117 West River Road N ",Minneapolis,MN,55411,"(612) 230-6466",cswenson@minneapolisparks.org,Restoration/Enhancement,"Minnesota Department of Natural Resources",,Hennepin,"Metropolitan - Urbanizing Area",,https://www.legacy.mn.gov/projects/wirth-park-habitat-enhancements,,,,

The City of Moorhead and other downstream communities obtain drinking water from the Red River. Since 85% of Moorhead's drinking water comes from the Red River, high turbidity results in higher treatment costs for their drinking water system. The Buffalo-Red River Watershed District (BRRWD) along with the Clay and Wilkin SWCDs will reduce erosion and sedimentation in Wolverton Creek by installing side inlets, bufferstrips, and conservation tillage. Significant gully erosion and scour erosion occurs along Wolverton Creek creating the turbidity and sediment problem.

Methods used included bird surveys, bird mist netting, insect hand netting, small mammal live trapping, trail cameras, and visual encounter surveys. Monitoring continues on an on-going basis.Project participants have included Zoo volunteers, area college students, boy scout troops, young professional associations, and more. In January 2014, the first public education program will take place.Public awareness of the program has included five presentations, including a Google+ hangout in partnership with Zoo Atlanta as well as presentations at the Minnesota School of Environmental Studies.  Social media pages for the BioDiscovery Project have been launched.Prairie Restoration Measurable OutcomesThe Zoo prairie was successfully developed in 2013. Featured plants included: black-eyed Susan, long-headed coneflower, pale purple coneflower, prairie phlox, spiderwort, prairie smoke, lobelia, pussy toes, fragrant giant hyssop, prairie onion, rattlesnake master, wild bergamot, white prairie clover, purple prairie clover, stiff tickseed, showy penstamon, hoary vervain, blue grama, side-oats grama, prairie June grass, wild Canada rye, and prairie dropseed.In 2013, the Zoo placed graphics adjacent to areas where the visitors congregate as they approach the entrance.  Visitors and zoo education program participants frequently visited the project by stopping to read the information. The signs discuss prairie ecology, certain species of plants and animals in the prairie, the status of today's prairie in Minnesota and the Midwest compared to their historical range, as well as discuss modern prairie conservation and the agencies/NGOs that are most active in this work.Over 169 hours of volunteer time were contributed to the project in 2013. Presentations were given in the field and classroom to the Minnesota Master Naturalist: Prairies and Potholes course, School of Environmental Studies, Great River Chapter of the American Society of Botanical Arts, Zoo staff, and Zoo Board of Directors. Two classes from the School of Environmental Studies helped seed prairie grasses and plugs in the fall.

Studies suggested that small areas of the landscape contribute disproportionately to nonpoint source pollution. So implementation of conservation projects that focus on those areas will maximize water quality benefits and ensure efficient use of resources. Using tools like Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and other Geographic Information System (GIS) data sets, candidate sites were identified and ranked as critical areas of soil erosion and surface runoff in the watershed. In addition, in-field assessment techniques were developed and documented to further evaluate these source locations. By the conclusion of the project a number of different methods to determine priorities of those critical areas were identified by local partners. They felt that using only one method to rank and sort the sites was not a good use of the dataset. The partners wanted to be able to sort and parse the results in a number of different ways according to both resource issues and impairments present. It was not always going to be similar for each sub-watershed. In the end the final selection of sites then became approximately 205 sites with resource attribution. This would allow a number of different ways of sorting and prioritizing. By combining the identified sites and in-field assessment techniques a set of protocols were established to determine the most appropriate BMPs needed to restore the sites to sustainable levels. A training session was provided to SWCD and County Staff's. A Digital Terrain Analysis Manual was published and is currently posted on the Zumbro Watershed Partnership website. This will be a guide to local partners in the watershed that along with the provided data sets, allows them to create their own priority sites data. PROJECT RESULTS USE AND DISSEMINATION The datasets were used to identify priority sub watersheds within the Zumbro. These sub watersheds were prioritized in the recently revised Zumbro Watershed Comprehensive Plan. In addition, the MN Board of Water and Soil Resources issued a request for information for the Targeted Watershed Demonstration Grant. This project was instrumental in identifying and defining the priority sub-watersheds that contained the most critical sites. In addition the in-field assessment and the BMP matrix allowed us to identify the most appropriate BMPs necessary to treat the sites. With BMPs identified, typical cost helped estimate project cost and the amount and type of public assistance needed at $1.6 M. The type and quality of the data from this project application also helped secure additional commitments from USDA NRCS for $750,000 in EQIP funding. The data continues to be used by county water planners in the development and revisions of County Water Plans. The GIS data sets are currently posted on an ftp site maintained by Barr Engineering. All county water planners and SWCD staff have access to the site. Because of the sensitive nature of the data access is limited to those staff persons at this time.
